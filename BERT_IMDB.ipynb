              " \"scott bartlett's 'offon' is nine minutes of pure craziness. it is a full-frontal assault of psychedelic, pulsating, epilepsy-inducing flashing lights and colours, and the first true merging of film and video in avante-garde cinema. there's no story to speak of, but bartlett uses images of nature \\x96 particularly the human face and form \\x96 to provoke a sequence of emotional reactions, integrating these biological phenomena into the highly-industrial form of modern technology. in a sense, the film represents the merging of humanity into his tools, his machinery, his technology. this theme connects loosely with the subplot of hal9000 in stanley kubrick's '2001: a space odyssey (1968),' and, indeed, bartlett's opening sequence of images \\x96 flashing colours before a close-up human eye \\x96 recalls dave bowman's journey through the stargate. the visuals are richly-coloured, a confronting blend of sharp, vivid photography and increasingly-grainy video, as though we're sitting too close to a television screen {as a matter of fact, the end product was recorded from a tv monitor}. there appears to be some confusion about the film's release date. imdb lists the film as a 1972 release, but both the national film registry and the national film preservation foundation give 1968 as the correct year. perhaps this disparity reflects the time between the film's completion and its first public screening. either way, the visuals are distinctly ahead of their time, occasionally reminiscent of a 1980s music video, and some brisk techno music wouldn't have gone amiss, either! 'offon' captures grainy, fragmented images, presenting life from the warped perspective of a computer processing too much information. i had a thought \\x96 and please don't laugh at this free-thinking interpretation \\x96 that an extraterrestrial civilisation capturing earth's television signals might very well receive such a disjointed, alien documentation of human life, a bizarre montage of only vaguely-familiar imagery that couldn't possibly make any coherent sense. perhaps this is where mankind, with all his technology, is eventually heading, towards an irreversible merging of film and video, of purity and artificiality.\",\n",

              " 'you know, robin williams, god bless him, is constantly shooting himself in the foot lately with all these dumb comedies he has done this decade (with perhaps the exception of \"death to smoochy\", which bombed when it came out but is now a cult classic). the dramas he has made lately have been fantastic, especially \"insomnia\" and \"one hour photo\". \"the night listener\", despite mediocre reviews and a quick dvd release, is among his best work, period. this is a very chilling story, even though it doesn\\'t include a serial killer or anyone that physically dangerous for that matter. the concept of the film is based on an actual case of fraud that still has yet to be officially confirmed. in high school, i read an autobiography by a child named anthony godby johnson, who suffered horrific abuse and eventually contracted aids as a result. i was moved by the story until i read reports online that johnson may not actually exist. when i saw this movie, the confused feelings that robin williams so brilliantly portrayed resurfaced in my mind. toni collette probably gives her best dramatic performance too as the ultimately sociopathic \"caretaker\". her role was a far cry from those she had in movies like \"little miss sunshine\". there were even times she looked into the camera where i thought she was staring right at me. it takes a good actress to play that sort of role, and it\\'s this understated (yet well reviewed) role that makes toni collette probably one of the best actresses of this generation not to have even been nominated for an academy award (as of 2008). it\\'s incredible that there is at least one woman in this world who is like this, and it\\'s scary too. this is a good, dark film that i highly recommend. be prepared to be unsettled, though, because this movie leaves you with a strange feeling at the end.',\n",

(to answer one other user: i am not talking about someone who just really doesn\\'t like the movie that much, and gave it a 5 or a 6, etc. everyone has, and is entitled to, his/her own taste. but no one can convince me that the imdb rating of only 7.0 overall for \"titanic\", pulled to that level by an inordinate number of ridiculous 1 ratings, is a fair reflection of the overall motion picture.) let me demonstrate my point by comparing the imdb user voting pattern of \"titanic\" to 5 randomly chosen box office and critical \"bombs\" (there are many more, but these 5 will prove my point). \"heaven\\'s gate\" (1980) was pulled from the theaters quickly after a very poor box office showing, and imdb voters\\' ratings were: 23.2% 10 ratings and 9.2% 1 ratings (overall rating of 6.1). \"big top pee-wee\" (1988) got 4.3% 10 ratings and 9.9% 1 ratings (overall rating of 4.5). \"cat people\" (1982) got 6.1% 10 ratings and 2.6% 1 ratings (overall rating of 5.8). \"blind date\" (1987) got 3.0% 10 ratings and 2.8% 1 ratings (overall rating of 5.3). \"jumpin\\' jack flash\" (1986) got 4.4% 10 ratings and 3.7% 1 ratings (overall rating of 5.2). what do all of these films have in common with \"titanic\"? all of the percentages of their 1 ratings are lower !!!! than \"titanic\", and none of these stinkers ever was nominated for a single award. again, \"titanic\" got 10.7% 1 ratings! compare that to the other 5 movies i just mentioned. can there be any explanation other than the hatred of leo factor?

              " \"titanic is a long but well made tragic adventure love story that takes place during the ill-fated voyage on the unsinkable ship. writer/director james cameron has done a great job of making this movie about a fictional love story between two very different people and combining that with the real event of the titanic that sunk after hitting an iceberg on april 15, 1912 claiming thousands of lives who perished in the icy freeing waters of the north atlantic. the two leads in the film are great in their roles including leonardo dicaprio and kate winslet. they make for a good on-screen couple. dicpario and winslet also had genuine chemistry together which made the romance that eventually blossoms between them that much more believable. they both showed real talent when this one came out and both of them have continued to show just that in their most recently films as well. the rest of the supporting cast including billy zane, kathy bates, frances fisher, jonathan hyde, and bill paxton in a small role are equally impressive as their characters who help bring them to life in this film. the love story, the action, suspense, and the special effects are magnificent done especially for that time. the horror of the situation the characters were in felt so real because it really happened making you want most of them to survive this life and death situation. the pacing was a little slow at times and it was a little long but the rest of the movie made up for it's few flaws. titanic makes for a great date movie which is sure to make some girls cry almost every time they watch it. the fact that this really happened definitely added to the movie making you feel sorry for all the lives lost when the titanic sunk into the atlantic after hitting an iceberg. overall titanic is a tragic heartbreaking story about two people who fall in love while on the ill-fated ship thats brought to life by the exceptional performances from the cast especially dicaprio and winslet who definitely make this movie worth the time to watch.\",\n",

              " 'after a brief prologue showing a masked man stalking and then slashing the throat of an older gentleman on a deserted, urban, turn of the century australian street, we meet julie (rebecca gibney) and peter (john adam) as they go out house hunting. they manage to get a loan for a fixer-upper on a posh sydney street, but it turns out that physical disrepair is not the only problem with their new home. it just may be haunted. 13 gantry row combines a memorable if somewhat clichéd story with good to average direction by catherine millar into a slightly above average shocker. the biggest flaws seem partially due to budget, but not wholly excusable to that hurdle. a crucial problem occurs at the beginning of the film. the opening \"thriller scene\" features some wonky editing. freeze frames and series of stills are used to cover up the fact that there\\'s not much action. suspense should be created from staging, not fancy \"fix it in the mix\" techniques. there is great atmosphere in the scene from the location, the lighting, the fog and such, but the camera should be slowly following the killer and the victim, cutting back and forth from one to the other as we track down the street, showing their increasing proximity. the tracking and the cuts need to be slow. the attack needed to be longer, clearer and better blocked. as it stands, the scene has a strong \"made for television\" feel, and a low budget one at that. after this scene we move to the present and the flow of the film greatly improves. the story has a lot of similarities to the amityville horror (1979), though the budget forces a much subtler approach. millar and scriptwriter tony morphett effectively create a lot of slyly creepy scenarios, often dramatic in nature instead of special effects-oriented, such as the mysterious man who arrives to take away the old slabs of iron, which had been bizarrely affixed to an interior wall. for some horror fans, the first section of the film might be a little heavy on realist drama. at least the first half hour of the film is primarily about julie and peter trying to arrange financing for the house and then trying to settle in. but morphett writes fine, intelligent dialogue. the material is done well enough that it\\'s often as suspenseful as the more traditional thriller aspects that arise later--especially if you\\'ve gone through similar travails while trying to buy your own house. once they get settled and things begin to get weirder, even though the special effects often leave much to be desired, the ideas are good. the performances help create tension. there isn\\'t an abundance of death and destruction in the film--there\\'s more of an abundance of home repair nightmares. but neither menace is really the point. the point is human relationships. there are a number of character arcs that are very interesting. the house exists more as a metaphor and a catalyst for stress in a romantic relationship that can make it go sour and possibly destroy it. that it\\'s in a posh neighborhood, and that the relationship is between two successful yuppies, shows that these problems do not only afflict those who can place blame with some external woe, such as money or health problems. peter\\'s character evolves from a striving corporate employee with \"normal\" work-based friendships to someone with more desperation as he becomes subversive, scheming to attain something more liberating and meaningful. at the same time, we learn just how shallow those professional friendships can be. julie goes through an almost literal nervous breakdown, but finally finds liberation when she liberates herself from her failing romantic relationship. although 13 gantry row never quite transcends its made-for-television clunkiness, as a tv movie, this is a pretty good one, with admirable ambitions. anyone fond of haunted house films, psycho films or horror/thrillers with a bit more metaphorical depth should find plenty to enjoy. it certainly isn\\'t worth spending $30 for a dvd (that was the price my local pbs station was asking for a copy of the film after they showed it (factoring in shipping and handling)), but it\\'s worth a rental, and it\\'s definitely worth watching for free.',\n",

was it really the best movie of all time? was that leonardo\\'s real nose? ok, i know that\\'s silly to say, but i did re-watch the film. being completely honest here, titanic is a great movie, best movie of all time, no, just depends on your idea of a good movie, but titanic delivered in romance, humor, disaster, emotions and never let us go on this maiden voyage. the film starts with brock lovett and his team exploring the wreck of the rms titanic, searching for a necklace set with a valuable blue diamond called the heart of the ocean. unsuccessful, they instead discover a drawing of a young woman reclining nude, wearing the heart of the ocean, dated the day the titanic sank. 101-year-old rose dawson calvert learns of the drawing, and contacts lovett to inform him she is the woman in the drawing. she and her granddaughter elizabeth \"lizzy\" calvert visit lovett and his skeptical team on his salvage ship. when asked if she knew the whereabouts of the necklace, rose calvert recalls her memories aboard the titanic, revealing for the first time that she was rose dewitt bukater. in 1912, the upper-class 17-year-old rose boards the ship with her fiancé, cal hockley and her mother, ruth dewitt bukater, both of whom stress the importance of rose\\'s engagement to cal since the marriage will mean the eradication of the dewitt-bukater debts: while they have the outward appearance of the upper-class, rose and her mother are financially broke. distraught and frustrated by her engagement to the controlling cal and the pressure her mother is putting on her to go through with the marriage, rose attempts suicide by jumping from the stern. before she leaps, a drifter and artist named jack dawson intervenes. jack and rose strike up a tentative friendship as she thanks him for saving her life, and he shares stories of his adventures traveling and sketching; their bond deepens when they leave a stuffy first-class formal dinner of the rapport-building wealthy for a much livelier gathering of irish dance, music and beer in third-class. but after cal\\'s servant informs him of rose\\'s whereabouts\\', rose is forbidden from seeing jack again. however, after witnessing a woman encouraging her seven-year-old daughter to behave like a \"proper lady\" at tea, rose defies him and her mother, asking jack to sketch her nude and wearing only the heart of the ocean, an engagement present from cal. after a beautiful moment together in the very first backseat fun time, they go to the deck of the ship. they then witness the ship\\'s fatal collision with an iceberg. after overhearing the ship\\'s lookouts discussing how serious the collision is, rose tells jack they should warn her mother and cal. meanwhile, cal discovers rose\\'s nude drawing and her taunting note in his safe, so he frames jack for stealing the heart of the ocean by having lovejoy plant it in jack\\'s pocket. upon learning cal intends to leave jack to die below deck, rose runs away from him and her mother to rescue him. jack and rose return to the top deck. cal and jack, though enemies, both want rose safe, so they persuade her to board a lifeboat. but after realizing that she cannot leave jack, rose jumps back on the ship and reunites with jack in the ship\\'s first class staircase. jack and rose return to the top deck, the lifeboats have gone, and the ship finally goes down into the freezing atlantic taking jack and rose down. so does titanic live up to it\\'s hype? i still say that this is a great movie to watch, i think that there were and still are quite a few haters that for some reason just want to trash the movie because it had won a ton of awards and everyone was in love with the movie. but it has great acting, amazing effects, a well-written story and still looks flawless. love it or hate it, you have to admit this movie didn\\'t get a lot of hype just because of leo\\'s baby face or kate\\'s amazing ability to cry on sight, this film is something special. it will always hold a special place in my heart, it has too seeing that i saw this film 8 times in the theater when it was released. but all that aside, i do recommend this movie, it\\'s a great one and sure to go down in the classics one day. 10/10',\n",

              " \"titanic directed by james cameron presents a fictional love story on the historical setting of the titanic. the plot is simple, noncomplicated, or not for those who love plots that twist and turn and keep you in suspense. the end of the movie can be figured out within minutes of the start of the film, but the love story is an interesting one, however. kate winslett is wonderful as rose, an aristocratic young lady betrothed by cal (billy zane). early on the voyage rose meets jack (leonardo dicaprio), a lower class artist on his way to america after winning his ticket aboard titanic in a poker game. if he wants something, he goes and gets it unlike the upper class who are so concerned with their social worries. the two fall in love and the audience sees the sinking of the titanic primarily through their eyes. the movie begins in modern times with the exploration of the wreck by a group searching for treasures, that sunk with the titanic, which has recently occurred. one of the survivors of the titanic, rose dewitt bukater, who had heard of the exploration of the wreck on television and is flown to the boat where the search is being led from to tell of what she remembers to help the search. she gets to telling her memory of the one and only voyage of the titanic. with this, the scene shifts to southhampton, ireland where the titanic set sail from on april 10, 1912 as all the passengers are boarding. after another stop on the irish coast titanic went out to see on its maiden voyage across the atlantic bound for new york. historically the first few days of the voyage went by uneventful, but the fictional plot of the story is developed during this time as rose sees the hopeless entrapement of an engagement that she is in to the wealthy cal hockley and falls in love with third class passenger, jack dawson. captain smith alledgedly as shown in the movie was urged by the white star line director to increase the speed of the ship so they would make the newspaper headlines and receive extra publicity by arriving in new york on thursday night and not on friday morning as planned. smith then ordered the fateful decision going against his thirty-two years of experience to stretch the titanic's legs out to full speed. the titanic had reports that the waters in the atlantic they were sailing in were full of icebergs, but they ignored these warnings and proceeded at full speed as shown in the movie. on april 15, 1912 at 11:39, an iceberg was sighted. they attempted to shut off the engines and turn the ship out of the path of the iceberg but there was not enough time and the ship hit the iceberg on the starboard side as depicted in the film. the portrayal of the many small holes in the side of the ship and not one large gash along the side is accurate. the crew of titanic sent out distress calls and set off distress rockets as shown until 2:18 when the lights finally failed. the lights of the california were spotted six miles away but they failed to realize what was going on and did not respond to titanic's many pleas for help. the california had tried earlier in the day to warn titanic of the severe ice that had caused them to stop their trip but titanic had brushed them off causing the california to turn off its radio and leave the titanic on its own. the first class women and children were the first as depicted to be put into the twenty lifeboats that were on the ship. overwhelmingly the third class passengers suffered the most amount of deaths of any class and the crew was hit hard in this tragedy too. the word of white star line employees and first class passengers was believed over that of second and third class passengers when authorities were trying to gain information of the sinking. also, the metal that was used to build the titanic has been found in recent years under conditions of severe cold, which were experienced the night titanic sank to be extremely brittle. overall, the basic plot is very accurate in its portayal of the events and the times at which these events took place on the titanic. many of the characters in the story were not real and created simply for the purpose of the movie or as composite characters to represent possible characteristics and ideas of people on the ship. the core group of rose, jack, cal, and rose's mother all were fictional characters added into the story as they represent different groups of people from the time. yet many characters such as the unsinkable molly brown; captain edward smith; the ship designer, thomas andrew; the white star line representative, bruce ismay; and all of the titanic's officers were real. the maiden voyage was going to be captain edward smith's last voyage anyway as he planned to retire afterwards. he had been a part of the white star line since 1880 where he worked his way up to his status as the millionaire's captain when the titanic sunk. the portrayals of the officers is accurate as only four survived the tragedy except for the officer who threatened to kill all of the passengers of the ship with his pistol. he is on record as acting heroicly and was misportrayed to the point that james cameron apologized and evoked a monument in his honor in the officer's former canadian hometown. as shown in the movie there was a language problem between the crew and many of the lower-class passengers from non-english speaking nations. in addition, officer lowe was the only officer who came back in the lifeboat as depicted. the old people shown in their bed as the water came in their room were based on the strauss'. not wanting to leave her husband's side mrs. strauss refused to get in her lifeboat and died with her husband on the titanic. furthermore, mr. goggenheim who was shown sipping his brandy and smoking a cigar reportedly did go out like this dressed in his best. the richest man on the ship, john jacob astor, who owned most of manhattan died nonetheless as well, but his much younger wife was saved in a lifeboat. in addition, molly brown was saved and later had medals made up for the crew of the carpethia that picked the survivors of titanic up from the water. her ticket on the titanic had cost over four-thousand dollars and by the end of her life she ended up broke. all of the interiors of the ship were masterfully replacated down to the last pieces of china and silverware. the gymnasium, which is hardly seen is recreated perfectly with all of the machines reproduced to match those seen in old photographs. the wonderful outfits and costuming were an excellent re-creation of the post-victorian era of 1912. the rich at this time practically ruled everything, as the women's suffrage movement had not quite gotten moving yet. women during this time often married for financial security as rose was considering doing and normally took a back seast status to their husbands as cal wished for rose to do. the rich did not take well to `new money' such as molly brown as depicted. everything of the time was very formal. women had to be escorted to dinner by a male figure as seen with in the dining scenes. smoking was not very common among women of the time but holders of cigarettes, which were just coming in at the time were used as seen with rose in the movie. men of the time generally smoked cigars not cigarettes. women were constained physically by their corsets and socially by society. although james cameron had no background in historical films he brought in experts of titanic coupled with two years spent cross-referencing the history of the titanic and few liberties were taken. the beautiful cinematography and special effects also helped to make the film even more breathtaking. a recognizable message can be seen in the movie titanic as the people on the ship had about three hours to contemplate their demise. the director, james cameron, shows the various reactions to this time of crisis in people's lives. everyone reacts differently and he gets you to think of how you might have reacted had you been in that situation on the titanic on that fateful night. in addition, this film is a reflection of the 1990's when it was produced as it gives a look into the wreck of the titanic. only in the past fifteen years has the site of the actual titanic been found and explored. this movie was able to give us a deeper look into a disaster that many would not have viewed. however, the moral question of whether people today should be taking treasures from the wreck of an underwater graveyard is posed. there have been attempts to stop treasure seeking missions such as the one portrayed in titanic but all have failed. as it stands today anyone can make a voyage to the titanic and take whatever valuables they as portrayed in the film showing the general values of our time on this matter. technically the film is very well done. to get footage of the wreck at the bottom of the ocean it took twelve dives to get all of the footage needed for the movie. in addition, a special camera had to be created to withstand the intense pressure at the bottom of the ocean. cameron did not plan on using the probe to go as far inside titanic as anyone has in the 88 years since the ship sunk but it worked out that this provided an unique perspective into the ship. furthermore, throughout the film fade ins and outs from the wreck of titanic to the scene of titanic during its actual voyage. this shift between the modern scene to the past scene during the voyage works as an excellent transition that makes the story easy to follow in aclear manner. at the very beginning of the movie a septune recreation is used to recreate the scene when the actual people left the european coast on titanic giving it distinction from the rest of the events of the film. titanic plays almost like a historical biography and is like a work of art, a true epic. like most history novels, we know the ending, but it doesn't take away from the wonderful treats that can be found in this picture. certain aspects of this film are academy award material including costuming, sound, cintematography, and editing. if you like interesting characters that will give you an insight into the life of characters in the early 1900's and how they face disaster, then this movie definitely is for you. \",\n",

(i know he was invited the first time; but he seems to keep getting into first class without being stopped until he\\'s been there for a while.) the realities of the separation of the social classes were much more realistically portrayed, i thought, when the steerage passengers were going to be left locked down there after the ship hit the iceberg while the first class folks got to enjoy half empty lifeboats. a minor quibble, though. this is truly an excellent movie. my only regret is not seeing it in the theatre, where i think it would have been so much more impressive. 9/10',\n",

              " 'shinjuku triad society, albeit from perfect, is a fiercely compelling film for what it tries to depict in its uber-conventional realm. it\\'s a yakuza/triad picture, involving cops versus japanese &/or chinese gangsters (mostly chinese, as the title suggests), but already even in his first technical \\'debut\\', takashi miike is already establishing many aspects to films that he would make from here-on in. social issues like black market trading of precious goods, in this case human organs usually from children; nostalgia for childhood and one\\'s roots, which was especially prevalent in dead or alive 2; thumbing-of-the-nose at taboos like gay sex and (satirical) rape/violence towards women; blood-curdling violence. it\\'s certainly not as surreal as some of miike\\'s most recent films, but this is expected as he\\'s trying out things that he\\'s just starting to learn, following a track record of straight to video programmers. it\\'s got all of those qualities, and it\\'s also, like the films that would follow from it, equally savage and heartfelt, crazy (in spots) and sardonic in its drama, and solid for genre fans. the story concerns two brothers, one a chinese orphan raised in japan, tatsuhito kiriya (kippei shiina, pretty decent as a eastwood-esquire anti-hero/hero), who\\'s become a detective, and another, who\\'s become a gangster, or a would-be one. the main arch likely takeover gang comes from wang (a definite pun on what the gang represents during its spare-time, played by tomorowo taguchi as a typical wacko with real terror in his eyes), and his partner karino (takeshi caesar, who\\'s threatening even when just repeating a commandment over and over to a woman who\\'s just had her eye plugged out following a sour deal), who are the ruthless kind to pop up almost organically in a miike movie. there\\'s some intrigue involving the organ-trading scheme with the gangsters, which kiriya almost becomes a victim of, and the gang\\'s penchant for gay sex- at least with one little puppet of sorts who does whatever the main gangsters want. it all leads up to vengeance and redemption, qualities that miike and his writer are trying to emulate from shakespeare (hence the macbeth bit with wang washing his bloody hangs over and over after some gay sex saying \"it won\\'t come off\"). if it doesn\\'t add up to the same emotional level of impact that a great shakespeare play would have, it\\'s par for the course of a film like this. miike\\'s goals are met, though just met, in his low-scale ambitions: a gangster picture with some added levels of harsh familial trouble (the main tension between the brothers comes out of profession and duty to parents), notes on the crueler aspects of underworld crime, and what the realm of unrepentant sex, with both sexes, brings out psychologically in the characters. at the same time, shinjuku triad society also contains more than a few moments of classic biting black-comedy from the miike oeuvre. some of it just has to be taken with a grain of salt for what the director does in his outrageousness, like the bit at the beginning with the chair smashing over the face, or the randomness of the \"interrogation\" as it goes into a very twisted area. there\\'s even a laugh-out-loud line from the young sex-slave after finishing an act on one of the bosses: \"thank you, mr. weeny-burger.\" miike and his writer don\\'t have enough here to make the film a full-on dark comedy like ichi or, of course, visitor q, but there\\'s enough to bring some appropriate levity to the darker aspects to the story and characters. as the first entry of the \"black society\" trilogy, as it\\'s called, i was quite impressed, and it\\'s a fine quasi-calling card from one of the craziest new artists in contemporary cinema.',\n",
              " \"this movie is the first of miikes triad society trilogy, and the trilogy kicks of to a great start. the movies in the trilogy are only connected thematically, and these themes are actually apparent in all his films, if you look close enough. shinjuku triad society is about a cop trying to prevent his kid brother from getting too involved with a rather extreme gang of outsiders, struggling their way to the top of tokyos yakuza. the kid brother is a lawyer, and the triad gang is becoming increasingly in need of one, as the movie progresses. the movie takes place in a very harsh environment, and is therefore pretty violent and tough. miike has done worse, but since this is a serious movie it hits you very hard. as usual there is also a lot of perverted sex, mostly homosexual in this one. the movie is in many ways a typical gangster movie, but with a great drive and true grittiness. if you've only seen miikes far-out movies (ichi the killer, fudoh etc.) this is worth checking out since it is sort of a compromise between his aggressive over-the-top style displayed in those movies and his more serious side, as seen in the other films of the trilogy. and as always with miike, there are at least two scenes in this that you'll never forget (see it and figure out which ones for yourself). 8/10\",\n",
              " 'a lot has been said about shinjuku triad society as the first true \"miike\" film and i thought this sort of description might have been a cliché. but, like all clichés, it is based on the truth. all the miike trademarks are here, the violence, the black humour, the homosexuality, the taboo testing and the difficult to like central character. shinjuku is however, one of miike\\'s most perfectly formed films. he says in an interview that if he made it again it would be different, but not necessarily better. i think what he means is that the film possesses a truly captivating energy and raw edge which seems so fresh that although he might be able to capture a more visually or technically complex movie he could not replicate or better the purity of this film. as you might expect, the violence is utterly visceral, gushing blood and gritty beatings are supplemented by a fantastic scene in which a woman has a chair smashed over her face. (only a miike film could let you get away with a sentence like that.) the film has a fantastic pace, unlike dead or alive which begins and ends strongly and dips in the middle. dead or alive also deals with similar issues, miike is clearly concerned about the relations between the japanese and chinese in the postwar period and this emotive subject is handled well here, the central character really coming to life when you begin to understand his past. i cannot sing shinjuku\\'s praises enough. i do not want to give away too much. this is miike before he began to use cgi to animate his films and is almost reminiscent of something like kitano\\'s sonatine. the central characters are superbly realized and the final twist guarantees that as soon as the film has finished you\\'ll be popping it back on again to work it all out.',\n",

              " 'a man and his wife get in a horrible car accident. when the wife is left in a persistent vegetative state, the man must choose between pulling the plug and letting her live. the decision is made even harder when he realizes her ghost wants to extract revenge on him and those around him. this comes to us from director rob schmidt, who made \"wrong turn\" (a film i have not seen). with only one horror film under his belt, and not a particularly notorious one at that, i was a bit reluctant to watch this episode, expecting schmidt to be a \"master of horror\" in only the most liberal sense. my apologies to him for my underestimation. as of episode 10 in a 13 episode season, this was actually the best one yet. the issue of the \"right to die\" is dealt with and covered in enough detail to be a solid plot device. however, this is only the foundation on which the story revolves. once the horror elements show up, the film goes from \"decent\" to \"spectacular\". great acting, great plot, great dialogue, great suspense. i was a little creeped out at times (which is good) and most of all: the gore is in extreme abundance! i read a review of this episode prior to watching it, where the reviewer said there is a strong hint of \"hellraiser\" in this. through the first part of the show, i had no idea what they were talking about. then there is a bit later where some images do remind me of \"hellraiser 2\". however, i in no way wish to say that this takes away from the film. i can see no other way to create the effect that was created, and in my opinion this looks remarkably better than \"hellraiser 2\". some plot twists show up later on, and might invite the viewer to give the film a second look. i didn\\'t watch it a second time, but i think the beginning would make more sense if i had (not that it\\'s confusing). the subplot with the dental hygienist is also nice, and i found myself going back and forth about whether i disliked the main character for his relationship with her or if i felt bad for him. he\\'s somewhat of an anti-hero to the whole story, if you will. i feel inclined to cheer for him as the protagonist, but he\\'s completely unlovable. while the stuart gordon episode may be better and i\\'m excited about the \"washingtonians\" episode, i think i could safely bet that this is the key episode of the season and by far the saving grace of what was otherwise lackluster and routine. when legends like john carpenter let me down (again) i get a bit worried about the genre\\'s future, but then a fresh face like rob schmidt comes along and gives me hope. this one is a keeper, and please bring schmidt back for season 3!',\n",
              " \"it's amazing that from a good, though not wonderful, film made back in the early nineties, a whole franchise can grow. 'stargate; sg1' is, without a doubt, a worthy addition to the science fiction genre and has the right to stand shoulder-to-shoulder with 'star trek' as the kings of sci-fi. following on from the 1994 feature film 'stargate', this series sees stargate command (a military/science organisation) figuring out that the stargate system can be used to travel to various planets across the galaxy and beyond and the military sets up a number of teams to explore. sg1 is one such team, headed by military veteran colonel jack o'neill, and includes archaeologist doctor daniel jackson, military scientist captain samantha carter and alien teal'c, who has betrayed his overlord leaders in the hopes of one day freeing his people. earth quickly makes an enemy of the goa'uld, a parasitic race who use humans as hosts and think themselves equal to gods. the top-notch cast have much to be congratulated for in bringing this show to life. richard dean anderson is perfect as the cynical and sarcastic o'neill, who can shift from boyish to deadly in the blink of an eye. michael shanks, as daniel, brings heart and an will of steel to the character, who has grown from wide-eyed innocence to darker and more hard-bitten as the show has progressed. amanda tapping, as carter, has perfected the balance between depicting her character's femininity without comprising the fact she is a strong, intelligent military scientist. christopher judge is excellent as the aloof teal'c, who is able to depict the character's emotions with subtlety. and don s davis is perfect as the esteemed general hammond who leads with a good balance of fairness and firmness. almost all the episodes are are involving and portrayed with intelligence, reflecting on moral dilemmas as well as the friction between military interests and civilian beliefs (often shown through arguments between o'neill and jackson). guest characters are solidly depicted and story arcs are handled in a manner that doesn't bore viewers. sg1 also excels in humour, from o'neill's wisecracks to episodes that are just wacky and odd! sg1 has everything from action to drama to romance to suspense to the heartbreaking scenes of death. it isn't just an excellent sci-fi show but is an excellent show, overall.\",\n",
              " 'fans of the hbo series \"tales from the crypt\" are going to love this moh episode. those who know the basic archetypal stories that most of the classic ec comics were based on, will recognize this one right off the bat. underrated indie favorite martin donovan (also an excellent writer - co-author of the screenplays for apartment zero and death becomes her) is the kind of guy whose everyman good looks can go either way. he could play a really nice if misunderstood guy-next-door, or he can play the same role with a creepy undertone of corrosive sleaziness. in the case of right to die, he takes the latter approach, and it definitely works. donovan is a doctor who has recently had an affair with his slutty office receptionist (robin sydney), much to the displeasure of his inconsolable, unforgiving spouse, abbey (julia anderson). when the two of them get involved in a terrible car accident while returning from an unsuccessful weekend of \"making up,\" and she\\'s horribly burned in a fire, he\\'s reluctant to pull the plug on her, not without some enthusiastic nudging from his even sleazier lawyer and best buddy (corbin bernsen, looking the worse for wear these days.) but abbey\\'s never been one to give up without a fight, and that\\'s where the ec-theme of the episode comes in. cuckolded husbands - and wives - have always been the genre\\'s favorite subject matter for some spooky (and ooky) supernatural shenanigans, and this case is definitely no exception. if anything, the ramped-up quotient of sex and gore must have bill gaines cackling with glee in his mausoleum somewhere. and that\\'s not to mention that john esposito\\'s original script does give the adultery angle just a slight twist. you don\\'t realize as you\\'re watching that you only know half the story, until close to the end...(think what lies beneath with more guts and gazongas, and you\\'re there.) not a bad effort, but not the best of the lot, either. at least rob schmidt does display touches of flair here and there with the direction, especially in a scene that makes cell phone picture messaging into a truly horrifying experience indeed! as with most moh episodes, this one is following a prevalent theme this season of flaying and dismemberment, so the extremely squeamish need not apply.',\n",

              " \"tim krabbe is the praised author of 'het gouden ei', a novel that was put on the screen twice ('spoorloos' and 'the vanishing'). one of the dutch writer's more recent works is 'de grot', a psychological thriller about two totally different men, egon and axel, who meet at a youth camp and, surprising enough, become friends for dear life. egon is a quiet, somewhat dull person, who spends his time studying and writing geography books. axel, on the other hand, is a charismatic 'party-animal', a heavy drinking criminal whose everyday's concern is to get a woman into his bedroom. from the moment they meet, axel has a strong influence on egon, while the latter envies him because he has a good life without really doing anything (such as reading thick books like egon); ultimately, egon is even dragged by egon into illegal practices himself, which leads to a fatal drug transport in a distant asian country. after having read the book last year, i was surprised the critics were quite positive about it. in my opinion, the book suffers especially from the complex structure. while krabbe presents the story as an absorbing portrait of an uncommon relationship between two people, the plot becomes more of a puzzle: the many episodes are not presented chronologically, so that two successive scenes are seldom in the same episode. because of this, the story feels surprisingly remote: you often need to know a character's background to really care for him or her. another complaint was the fact that the main characters, egon and axel, are a little stereotypical. egon is 'the' dull intellectual, while axel is his exact opposite. in real life, such one-dimensional people rarely exist; in books and films, they always seem to be there, taking away a lot of credibility. despite all this, the film was a pleasant surprise, being much better than the book. the adaptation excels in its beautiful cinematography, humour and acting: fedja van huet (egon) is one of the few dutch actors who can make you forget he is acting (which is, in my opinion, the highest an actor can achieve). the drawbacks of the film, however, are the same as the book's: mainly because the characters are one-dimensional, they are so predictable that it becomes annoying. guess who wrote the script? indeed, krabbe himself. it is obvious that this talented director (that's what the movie makes clear anyway) is hampered by a deficient screenplay. perhaps koolhoven should just have chosen a better book. 7/10\",\n",

              " 'seeing this movie was the most fun i\\'ve had at the cinema in a long time. however, i am not able to say whether this is a good or a bad film, because such simple qualifications simply cannot be applied. this picture has everything any movie could ever have. it has characteristics of a romantic comedy, a political commentary, a thriller, a drama, an action movie, a musical, and an absurdist self-conscious art film. it\\'s all in there, adding up to a myth. the basic premise is about an indian couple, nandini (karishma kapoor) and shekhar (sanjay kapoor), happily living in canada, who rush to india to visit the husband\\'s parents after a disturbing news report. the rest of the story takes place in india, where the couple find themselves in the midst of a plot of fratricidal violence. at one point, the story borrows from \"not without my baby,\" but to call shakti a remake of anything would be an injustice. the ostensible story line takes a backseat to a number of astonishing interruptions, including shah rukh khan\\'s dream of aishwarya rai which comes as if out of another movie. in fact, the two stars are on all the posters, but they appear really late in the film, and only shah rukh ends up being a real character. yet he makes up for it with a spirited and truly unexpected performance. karishma kapoor is the one with most work to do in this film, and she does an admirable job, having to link up the film\\'s twists and turns with a show of believable emotion. another notable presence is nana patekar, who plays narsimha, the tyrannical father of the husband shekhar. nana patekar dominates every scene he\\'s in with a scary but nuanced character. the movie is not without its share of realism. violence is rampant, but truly disturbing in the abuse received by most of the female characters, with karishma getting soundly beaten on a number of occasions. at times, this violence is clearly disturbing but ultimately it becomes surreal as every dramatic sequence is usually followed by such comic and spectacular turns that the overall effect is nothing but cathartic. i have seen a share of bollywood releases, and the mixing of genres and incredible plot resolutions are certainly their norm. but \"shakti\" raises the bar by absorbing an even greater masala without becoming ridiculous. it is a film that achieves the grandeur of a shakespearian tragedy, where the audience of the rabble and royalty is equally entertained. it is pure, gratuitous cinema, and the director krishna vamsi must have had a dream of a good time by throwing in every trick in the book. perhaps, the all-important message of violence begetting violence and the inspiring extents of motherly love were not the thoughts on my mind, but i came out of watching \"shakti\" exhilarated. making movies can be the most fun in the world!',\n",
              " \"okay, i know this does'nt project india in a good light. but the overall theme of the movie is not india, it's shakti. the power of a warlord, and the power of a mother. the relationship between nandini and her husband and son swallow you up in their warmth. then things go terribly wrong. the interaction between nandini and her father in law - the power of their dysfunctional relationship - and the lives changed by it are the strengths of this movie. shah rukh khan's performance seems to be a mere cameo compared to the believable desperation of karisma kapoor. it is easy to get caught up in the love, violence and redemption of lives in this film, and find yourself heaving a sigh of relief and sadness at the climax. the musical interludes are strengths, believable and well done.\",\n",

              " 'the beauty of this film is evidenced in the great portrayal of the power of a mother\\'s love, the exceptional performances, the steady execution and the quite innovative script. the film tells the story of an indian woman, nandini, who lives in canada with her husband shekhar and little kid raja. all of a sudden her husband informs her that his family in india (of whom she had not even known) is in troubles and the couple rush to india. when they get into the village, nanadini is shocked and terrified to witness a very wild rural culture; shekhar\\'s family, ruled by his cruel, highly cynical and merciless father narasimha, lives a poor and highly violent lifestyle which is full of murder and terror and where women are subservient and helpless. nandini starts nagging shekhar to return home, but he is soon killed by his father\\'s enemies. when she wants to leave, narasimha refuses to let her take raja back to india. here starts the intense struggle which can be called \"nandini vs. narasimha\". india is not presented in a particularly positive light in this film, but it only shows a very tiny minority of its rural areas, so it may be even correct. the portrayal is in my view fair and not one-sided because the positive side is also presented to an extent. such a horrifying sight could be shown in a film about any country in the world. the locations are amazing, the music is wonderful, and krishna vamshi\\'s direction is aided by very effective cinematography and good editing. one thing that must be noted is the very ear-pleasing background score by ismail darbar, it is beautiful. the characters are very well defined though we do get to see both their bright and dark sides in different portions of the film. portrayed realistically throughout, the film flows well and is an interesting and fairly entertaining watch. its dialogues are superb and intelligently written, and although the shocking proceedings can be very disturbing at some points, a great deal of positive moments manage to relieve the tension. the film\\'s biggest strength is the performances. karisma kapoor is breathtaking and very believable as nandini. her ability to strike a balance between vulnerability and unrestrained emotion is simply incredible. she displays so much intensity, impulsiveness, anguish and determination as the mother who wants to get her son back that this little kid seems to be her own son. her outbreaks while facing off nana patekar which are like volcanic eruptions show us how the simplest of women can become a tigress when it comes to her child. after fiza, this is her most powerful performance. one of the greatest actors indian cinema has seen, nana patekar is indescribable as narasimha. he manages to be hateful as narasimha yet admirable as the actor who plays him. patekar displays cruelty, wittiness and even humanity with total conviction. he is outstanding. another great performance comes unsurprisingly from india\\'s most underrated actress, deepti naval, who sensitises her character to perfection. sanjay kapoor is just adequate and shahrukh khan provides great comic relief. anyway, do watch shakti - it could have been better, but it is definitely a must-watch.',\n",
              " \"if any movie stands out extremely with the actors' acting skills, this is probably the one. i've never seen dialogues be spoken in such a rough way, but having a strong feeling. the movie was disturbing at moments. however, the movie was terrible at editing. the movie tries to go the commercial way by adding comedy and songs, yet they feel out of place. like karisma is getting beat up, and the same time srk is fighting (comically) with the police officers. the ishq kamina song was very out of place. on top of that, the movie is overly glossy in the beginning. the direction was not bad, but certainly nothing one can brag about. i have to say that the actors' were chosen very wisely. without them, this movie would not have an impact. karisma kapoor has given her best role to date, and this looks very good on her record after zubeidaa and fiza. she looks pretty in the first half, and i've never seen an actress scream of emotion and anger as well as her. what is most ironic is this is probably her weakest written role to date. nana patekar was excellent as her father-in-law. not much to say about him, besides this is a role made for him. deepti naval as the mother-in-law was excellent especially in her final scene. though she doesn't have much to say, her facial expressions and body language was good. the other good performance was the little kid. he was adorable, and is sure to bring tears to the viewer's eyes. the movie was probably saved desperately by their performances. sanjay kapoor was all right, but he didn't have much to do. shahrukh khan was wasted in his bad boyish type role. one thing that brought the audience to the theater was ishq kamina. the song picturization and dancing is perfect for the crude lyrics of the song. and boy aish is mad hot. however, the song belonged to be in another movie only because it came at the worst moment ever. people may have come to the movie for aish, but they won't brag too much about it after-wards. hum tum miley was properly paced, but seemed to drag as the suspense mood was leaving throughout the movie. damroo bhaje was boring and nothing to rave about. dil ne pukara is too boring of a song to get the mood of the movie. despite the poor editing, the performances alone make it a must see.\",\n",
              " 'on sunday july 27, 1997, the first episode of a new science fiction series called \"stargate sg-1\" was broadcast on showtime. a spin-off of and sequel to the 1994 film \"stargate\" starring kurt russell and james spader, the series begins approximately one year after the events portrayed in the film. for ten seasons, it chronicled the adventures and misadventures of an intrepid team of explorers known as sg-1. originally, the series starred richard dean anderson as colonel jack o\\'neill (two \"l\"s!), michael shanks as dr. daniel jackson, amanda tapping as captain samantha carter, christopher judge as teal\\'c and don s. davis as major general george s. hammond. for ten long years, we watched the team battle against the goa\\'uld, the replicators, the ori and many other aggressors. at the same time, they forged alliances with the asgard, the tok\\'ra, the rebel jaffa, the nox and the tollan. they saved the world no less than eight times over the years and never gave up, not until death claimed them. and sometimes not even then. as with all long-running series, they were numerous cast changes. michael shanks left the series in january 2002 at the end of its fifth season in order to broaden his horizons as an actor. daniel jackson\\'s successor as the team\\'s resident archaeologist/geek was jonas quinn, an alien from a country called kelowna on the planet langara, played by corin nemec. however, shanks returned at the beginning of the seventh season in june 2003 and nemec left at the same time. unfortunately, he made only one further guest appearance and his character was seldom mentioned afterwards. don s. davis left the series at the end of the seventh season in march 2004 as he felt that it was time for him to go. the show\\'s original star and arguably its most popular actor, richard dean anderson, starred in the series throughout its first eight seasons. his participation in the seventh and eight seasons was noticeably less than in the earlier seasons. he finally left \"sg-1\" in march 2005 in order to spend more time with his then six-year-old daughter. jack o\\'neill was by far my favourite character in the series and, truth be told, i never enjoyed the last two seasons as much as i did the earlier episodes for that very reason. the ninth season represented a new era for the programme. with the departure of its lead actor and the defeat of the goa\\'uld and the replicators in season eight, many fans felt the series should go out on a high. regardless, the series carried on for a further two years with the ori replacing the goa\\'uld as the series\\' main adversaries. three new characters were brought in to fill the gaps as it were and help usher in this re-invention. ben browder came in as the cocky southern air force pilot lt. colonel cameron mitchell, the new leader of sg-1. his \"farscape\" co-star, the lovely claudia black, began to play a prominent role in the series as the vivacious, sexy, hilarious and certainly extroverted vala mal doran, a former goa\\'uld host and con artist from another planet. a recurring guest star during the eighth and ninth seasons, she joined the cast full time at the beginning of its tenth and final season. rounding off the cast was the legendary beau bridges as major general hank landry, the new commander of the sgc and an old friend of jack o\\'neill and general hammond. for the last two years, they starred alongside the \"sg-1\" faithful (michael shanks, amanda tapping and christopher judge) and became valuable parts of and made equally valuable contributions to the stargate franchise. alas, all good things must come to an end. during the initial broadcast of the first several episodes of season ten, ratings dropped considerably, resulting in cancellation in its august 2006. after ten seasons and 214 episodes, the dream was finally over. on march 13, 2007, what began with \"children of the gods\" ended with \"unending\". the series finale made its world premiere on sky one in britain and ireland before being shown on the sci-fi channel in the united states on june 22, 2007. in the ten years that the series was on the air, it amassed legions of fans and even eclipsed the science fiction series, \"star trek\", in terms of popularity in certain countries. it became the second-longest running sci-fi series in the world, second only to \"doctor who\" (1963-1989), and the longest-running american produced sci-fi series, having surpassed \"the x-files\" only a few months before it ended. \"stargate sg-1\" represents the cornerstone of the \"stargate\" franchise. in 2004, its success and popularity led to the production of a spin-off series entitled \"stargate atlantis\", which was regrettably cancelled after five seasons and 100 episodes in august 2008. although plans for another feature film fell through, two direct-to-dvd films, \"stargate: the ark of truth\" and \"stargate continuum\", were released in 2008 and more are planned for the not too distant future. a third live-action series, \"stargate universe\", is also due to premiere at some point next year. (there was, unfortunately, an animated series, \"stargate infinity\", which ran only from 2002 to 2003 but the less said about that the better). despite the end of \"sg-1\" and \"atlantis\" as continuing series, the future of \"stargate\" looks very bright indeed. in conclusion, while \"stargate\" has yet to gain the same degree of popular recognition as other major sci-fi television franchises such as \"star trek\" and \"doctor who\", its still relatively new compared to those two sci-fi giants and i have every confidence that it will continue for many, many years to come.',\n",

              " '\"stargate sg-1\" follows the intergalactic explorations of a team named sg-1 through a device called the stargate and all the surprises awaiting on the other side of the wormhole. having seen this series sporadically for it\\'s first few seasons when it first came out, i didn\\'t know how good this series would really be, 10 years after i had last seen an episode. my old impression was that the series was great, but my impression was far from the truth. \"stargate sg-1\" is more than just a simple sci-fi series, it is one of the most well made, interesting, long running, exciting sci-fi ever produced. and why? because it runs on an amazing premise. this series value far surpasses that of the movie it was based on and i think it is a very good example that television, as a medium, with a suitable premise, is able to provide something that doesn\\'t work on the time restriction of film. the sense of familiarity created by a long running series, watching the characters and their circumstances progressing with time is stunning and just adds to the ability to suspend disbelief, and it\\'s all a result of terrific writing and a lot of dedication by the all crew to the show. \"stargate sg-1\" kept offering great adventures throughout the 10 years, but was never afraid of the challenge of moving the plot and it gave way for some very different time periods of the show: - the first few seasons, perhaps up to the 4th/5th, focused a lot more on the exploration of planets and different situations, keeping the episodes fairly unrelated to each other if it were not for the always impending goaul\\'d threat. - from the 5th to the 7th there was increasingly more episodes focusing on fighting the goaul\\'d and preventing attacks on earth. after this seasons exploration of the planets was almost only an excuse for putting sg-1 in a place of goaul\\'d/replicator/ori conflicts - the 8th season is probably the most mixed one. it has a stream of episodes that includes minor earth matters in which the stargate is hardly even mentioned, but the last episodes feature some great replicator moments. - the 9th and 10th travel together because they have the same new enemy and no jack o\\'neil. they are both good continuations, although the first few episodes of the 10th season are a little weak, because they seem to be about little more than sg-1 and human/jaffa losing battle after battle to the ori. basically, after season 7, exploration was pushed to the background, which in many ways was a shame, because of the potential and mystery each planet(episode) presented; on the other hand, it made for so many great episodes of the ongoing conflicts that the change of nature of the show still worked and shows how great and bold the writers were. even tough i believe the series have a high quality ending that nicely puts it to rest, the feeling i have is that it could go on; the people involved were all great professionals and the series narrative had plenty to offer. a last season returning to the beginning nature of the series was very doable and would have been most welcome, but ultimately things are as they are. in the end, because of the fact that i enjoyed everything, it\\'s a little hard to find that it ends. the big picture, however, the one drawn by the work of hundreds of people over the course of 10 years, is a sight of beauty and a true testament to the dedication of the crew, those outstanding actors and the characters the we will always remember as a collective by the name of sg-1.',\n",

              " \"i haven't always been a fan, but the show grew on me. it wasn't until after season 5 that i started to see the richness of the show. they finally brought daniel jackson's search for his wife to an end and finally most of the go,ould system lords were killed by rival lords, sg-1 or others. towards season 5, stargate sg-1, was beginning to become stale. with the new writers and the close attention by produer peter deleuise, the show became more and more solid. the characters had become stale as well. colonel jack o'neill was the stereotypical hero with emotional baggage. after his son charlie was killed in a shooting accident with o'neill's weapon, he had decided to end his own life by going to abydos in order to face off with the go'ould ra. the character offers little growth for any actor and actor richard dean anderson chose to play him straight raising emotional barriers to protect himself. only allowing his close friends in. amanda tapping joined the cast as captain samantha carter. she was a feminist on the edge, ready to battle any man who would doubt her ability to do her job. though this character had little area to grow, tapping has done a great job of concentrating on carter's strengths. she has taken the time to get a basic understanding of some of the things carter talks about in order that she can present the character intelligently. christopher judge joined the cast playing the alien teal'c. teal'c was an alien called the jaffa. infant go'ould, (snake like creatures) would embed themselves into the jaffa until they had grown to the point when it would be inserted into another life form. the jaffa would die. teal'c was the first prime of apophis' army. knowing that apophis was not a god like go'ould pretend, he realized the genocide that their armies had wreaked on the galaxy. finally, having had enough, he and jack o'neill freed their team along with quite a few innocent people. after arriving on earth, he realized that earth was the planet he was looking for, who would help him fight the go'ould. christopher judge has done quite a bit with a limited character. teal'c is a wise warrior, much of which he learned was from his teacher master bra'tac. the show would not be complete without master bra'tac played by tony amandola. he is also a rock. in the end, he became adviser to most of sg-1, especially daniel jackson. don s. davil was there from the beginning playing major general george hammand. davis has done an incredible job with hammond making him sympathetic and normal. he does his job, has a wife, sons and daughters and grandchildren. you can really say, he is the anchor of the base. simply, i would die for that man. if not allowed by his superiors to provide troops to support teams off world. he will go himself. he doesn't leave anyone behind. i saved dr. daniel jackson for last, because this character, i believe has grown the most in the ten or eleven years it has been on. in choosing shanks i don't think the producer realized how strong shanks would be and now when people talk about jackson, they don't talk about spader, they talk about shanks. in the early years, the jackson character came off as a whiner. that's why i probably wasn't a fan. as the seasons pasted, the character became stronger. this gave him confidence. in the end, as of season 10, the jackson character has matured to the point that he has become a self sacrificing hero. he still monitors the groups ethics. he still is lead at providing information that can move any mission forward. acheaology, history, culture and exploration are part of his very being. he is determined. though a man of peace, he has matured to the point that using his weapons may be the only way to solve a disagreement. other characters include, most recently: vala mal doran(claudia black) and colonel cameron mitchell(ben browder), new lead of sg-1. both actors come from a series called farscape and why they were put together is any bodies guess. i see little difference between mitchell and crichton (farscape character). black's character is simply off the wall. definitely different from her soldier like character arin soon.\",\n",

              " 'i do try not to take imdb ratings to heart, but i was flabbergasted when i saw the 5.4 rating to one of my childhood favourites. it doesn\\'t wow me as much at 17, but as a family film this is a sweet and well meaning movie. kids will definitely love it and won\\'t mind the flaws, and the adults can guess the actor behind each character and admire the subliminal messaging of the film. none of the film was preachy in any way, in fact it has a great message that added to its sweetness. i will admit though that the story is on the thin side, and some scenes like screweyes\\'s death(which still freaks me out) may be a tad on the scary side. but the animation is well above average with nice colours and good character animation. the music by james horner is very beautiful, and the song featured is memorable, catchy and amusing. i really liked the characters, louie is probably the most in-depth of them all, but the dinosaurs were at least engaging. martin short\\'s clown was both hilarious and emphatic, the part when he tells screweyes \"i quit!\" had me in stitches. my favourite is screweyes though, an effective villain who is crafty and i suppose intelligent. if anything though, i wish the film kept in the part when he explains how he lost his eye and why he is scared of crows because that way he could\\'ve been more developed in terms of depth. the script, while not oscar-worthy, has its funny and heart-warming parts, and should keep kids and adults entertained. the voice acting for me was what made the movie. john goodman, martin short, rhea perlman, felicity kendall and yeardley smith all gave solid performances, but special mention has to go to kenneth mars for he was absolutely superb as screweyes and almost unrecognisable. all in all, this is a good movie. i don\\'t get the rating, honestly i don\\'t. sure this film isn\\'t perfect, and it is not as good as a dinosaur movie such as land before time, but it is good fun. 7.5/10 bethany cox',\n",
              " \"i saw this when it first came to video, my little sister got it as a gift and i was probably 12 at the time... what stood out for me was the lack of mid-movie conflict that so many movies have, where the main characters get mad at each other because when it comes time to explain themselves they just don't say the one thing that you're shouting at the screen that would make sense of the whole deal, that any person of reasonable intellect would know to say. this is what i like the most about the movie i guess, that the main characters don't do mean things to each other halfway through... they don't break up and make up, they just grow to like each other more as the movie goes on. these two kids team up and though they seem at first to be from opposite sides of the track, they're not that different. loui is actually just some middle class kid that needed to realize how lucky he was to have a loving family, and cecelia was an upper class kid that just needed to prove to her family that she existed and they would miss her if she was gone. anyway, i saw this movie posted on hulu and had to watch it again... sure there's plot holes if you analyze the script and no, woog and dweeb shouldn't be eating hot dogs since they would have been herbivores in reality. now, what detracts from the film is it's unexpected scariness. little kids under the age of 5 would probably be frightened by the scenes with dr. screweyes. and, the addition of him halfway through the movie (though it's blatantly obvious in the first scene that he will make an appearance) is too abrupt... there should be a glimpse of him doing his show earlier in the movie, perhaps to show that it's not that scary without the the dinosaurs. i guess it just lacked any real present danger for the entire first half of the movie, so that it lacks a little continuity when he appears for the second half. considering the target audience, who i'm sure can overlook the not so mind blowing animation and dialog issues... i think i'll give it a pass on those factors too, and just enjoy the story. it's a great flick for kid and it does stick in your mind... makes you kinda think about how you treat people and it should be revisited every 10 years i think.\",\n",

              " \"i enjoyed this show for two reasons 1. richard dean anderson 2. amanda tapping. these two performers carried the show with able support from the regulars and recurring actors. the replacement of rda in seasons 9-10 was enough to take the heart out of the show. the chemistry between all the main characters is just tremendous. you get the feeling that the actors like to pal around after the camera stops rolling. this relationship carries over into the program we get to see. rda gives his 'o'neill' character believable personality. he never knows when to give the wiseass in him a rest. you watch the others roll their eyes in dismay at some of his utterances. still, they know that he is the man to have around when the situation is perilous. there is a lot going on between 'carter' and 'o'neill' under the surface. they manage to keep the lid on, but often just barely. the episode 'solitudes' in season 1 had some of the best drama ever seen on television. the love between the two made the prospect of dying bearable because they faced it together. 'carter' and 'jackson' often have to smooth over some of the turbulence created by 'o'neill'. yet 'o'neill's' tactical instincts always seem sound. he understands what to do without having to think about the matter. the team has several times been placed in jeopardy by the others not listening to his orders. the quality declined markedly in seasons 9 and 10. the original story arc was mostly used up and the new villains never really caught my interest. ben browder was far inferior to rda in carrying the show. he had his rare moments with claudia black, but that was all. amanda tapping was phoning in her performances these two seasons. you could see her greatly changed appearance after having a baby. she was probably thinking more about the child than the show. the spin-off 'stargate atlantis' has a few moments, but is mostly a weaker effort. the major characters lack the chemistry of the cast of the original. the villains (wraiths) are so improbable as to be ludicrous. maybe amanda tapping can breathe some life into the program or it won't last beyond the fourth season. there has always been a problem for me in the special effects for the show. to have spaceships shaped as pyramids is a design monstrosity seldom equaled in sci-fi. the use of torches for illumination in these ships is just as bad. the campy use of decor from ancient egypt concealing ultra-modern technology is just as hard to accept. i wondered about some of the continuity on the show too. in the season 2 opener, 'daniel jackson' is shot up and his uniform has a gaping hole where he was wounded. he crawls into a sarcophagus and it heals his body and restores his uniform like it just came off the rack in the wardrobe closet. the episode 'hathor' has a sarcophagus fall into the hands of the sgc, yet it is never mentioned again. this device could have been used in several later episodes on 'daniel', 'o'neill', and 'dr. frasier'.\",\n",

(in that film, john cusack was sort of bland but that was the nature of his character.) the acting here is very flat (i sometimes wondered if the bland acting by crouse was supposed to be some sort of attack on psychoanalysis). at least in the beginning. it never gets really good, but it evolves beyond painfully stiff line reading after about ten minutes. early in the film, some of lindsay crouse\\'s lines -- the way she reads them -- sound as if they\\'re inner monologue or narration, which they aren\\'t. with the arrival of mantegna things pick up. the dialogue here isn\\'t as fun as it should be. i was expecting crackerjack ring-a-ding-ding lines that roll off the tongue, but these ones don\\'t. it all sounds very read, rather than spoken. maybe mamet evolved after this film and loosened up, but if not, then maybe he should let others direct his words. he\\'s far too precious with them here and as a result, they lose their rhythmic, jazzy quality. what\\'s more strange is that other than this, the film doesn\\'t look or feel like a play. the camera is very cinematic. my only problem with \"glengarry glen ross\" was that it looked too much like filmed theatre, but in that film the actors were not only accomplished, but relaxed and free. everything flowed. i wouldn\\'t mind so much if it sounded like movie characters speaking movie lines -- or even play characters speaking play lines -- but here it sounds like movie (or even book) characters speaking play lines. it\\'s a weird jumble of theatre and film that just doesn\\'t work. that doesn\\'t mean the movie is bad -- it isn\\'t, it\\'s often extremely entertaining. the best chunk is in the middle. it\\'s standard con movie stuff: the new guy (in this case, girl) margaret ford (lindsay crouse) gets involved in the seedy con underworld. how she gets involved is: she\\'s a psychiatrist and one of her patients, billy is a compulsive gambler. she wants to help him out with his gambling debt, so she walks into the house of games, a dingy game room where con men work in a back room. i\\'ll admit the setup is pretty improbable. (were they just expecting crouse to come in? were they expecting she\\'d write a cheque? was billy in on it? one of these questions is definitely answered by the end, however.) and from here the cons are start to roll out. i found the beginning ones -- the little learner ones -- to be the most fun. we\\'re getting a lesson in the art of the con as much as crouse is. we see the ending coming, and then we didn\\'t see the second ending coming, and then the real ending i didn\\'t see coming but maybe you did. the ball just keeps bouncing back and forth and by the last scene in the movie we realize that the second crouse walked into the house of games she found her true calling. i\\'m going to forgive the annoying opening, the improbable bits and the strange line-reading because there are many good things here. if the first part of the movie seems stagy, stick with it. after the half-hour mark it does really get a momentum going. if you want a fun con movie, then here she is. if you want mamet, go watch \"glengarry glen ross\" again -- james foley did him better. ***',\n",
              " 'if your idea of a thriller is car chases, explosions, and dozens of people being mowed down by gunfire, then \"house of games\" is definitely not the movie for you. if you like and appreciate psychological drama and suspense, then, by all means, see it. \"house of games\" tells the story of an esteemed psychologist and writer, dr. margaret ford (lindsay crouse), who tries to help a patient and gets involved in the shadowy world of con men led by the charismatic mike (joe mantegna). to say anything more about the plot would ruin the suspense. frankly, i find it hard to believe anyone who says they saw the twists coming. just like a clever con artist, this movie draws you into its web and lulls your vigilance. the story is taut and well-crafted, the dialogue smart and laconic, the acting uniformly good (mantegna is superbly charismatic). some have complained that dr. ford is not a very sympathetic character, and wondered why mamet would make lindsay crouse look so physically unattractive. but dr. ford is supposed to be cold and aloof; moreover, her homeliness is in a way essential to the plot (at one point, i believe that an injury to her sexual self-esteem is a key part of her motivation ... i\\'ll say no more). \"house of games\" is a dark look at the underside of human nature that concludes on a note of discomforting ambiguity. it will hold your attention every second while you are watching, and stay with you for a long time afterwards.',\n",

              " \"`the united states of kiss my ass' house of games is the directional debut from playwright david mamet and it is an effective and at times surprising psychological thriller. it stars lindsay crouse as best-selling psychiatrist, margaret ford, who decides to confront the gambler who has driven one of her patients to contemplate suicide. in doing so she leaves the safety and comfort of her somewhat ordinary life behind and travels `downtown' to visit the lowlife place, house of games. the gambler mike (played excellently by joe mantegna) turns out to be somewhat sharp and shifty. he offers crouse's character a deal, if she is willing to sit with him at a game, a big money game in the backroom, he'll cancel the patients debts. the card game ensues and soon the psychiatrist and the gambler are seen to be in a familiar line of work (gaining the trust of others) and a fascinating relationship begins. what makes house of games interesting and an essential view for any film fan is the constant guessing of who is in control, is it the psychiatrist or the con-man or is it the well-known man of great bluffs david mamet. in house of games the direction is dull and most of the times flat and uninspiring, however in every david mamet film it is the story which is central to the whole proceedings, not the direction. in house of games this shines through in part thanks to the superb performances from the two leads (showy and distracting) but mainly as is the case with much of mamet's work, it is the dialogue, which grips you and slowly draws you into the film. no one in the house of games says what they mean and conversations become battlegrounds and war of words. everyone bluffs and double bluffs, which is reminiscent of a poker games natural order. this is a running theme throughout the film and is used to great effect at the right moments to create vast amounts of tension. house of games can also be viewed as a `class-war' division movie. with lindsay crouse we have the middle-class, well-to-do educated psychiatrist and joe mantegna is the complete opposite, the working class of america earning a living by `honest' crime. the film seduces the viewer much like crouse is seduced by mantegna and the end result is ultimately a very satisfying piece of american cinema. and the final of the film is definitely something for all to see and watch out for, it's stunning. an extremely enjoyable film experience that is worth repeated viewings. 9/10\",\n",
              " \"david mamet wrote the screenplay and made his directorial debut with `house of games,' a character study fraught with psychological overtones, in which a psychiatrist is lured into the dark world of the confidence game. margaret ford (lindsay crouse) has a successful practice and has written a best-selling novel, 'driven.' still, she is somewhat discontented with her own personal life; there's an emptiness she can neither define nor resolve, and it primes her vulnerability. when a patient, billy hahn (steven goldstein), confides to her during a session that he owes big money to some gamblers, and that they're going to kill him if he doesn't pay, she decides to intervene on his behalf. this takes her to the `house of games,' a seedy little dive where she meets mike (joe mantegna), a charismatic con-man who wastes no time before enticing her into his world. instead of the `twenty-five large' that billy claimed he owed, mike shows her his book, and it turns out to be eight hundred dollars. and mike agrees to wipe the slate clean, if she'll agree to do him one simple favor, which involves a card game he has going on in the back room. in the middle of a big hand, mike is going to leave the room for a few minutes; while he is gone, her job is to watch for the `tell' of one of the other players. by this time, not only margaret, but the audience, as well, is hooked. the dialogue, and mamet's unique style and the precise cadence with which his actors deliver their lines, is mesmerizing. as mike leads margaret through his compelling, surreal realm of existence, and introduces her to the intricacies of the con game, we are swept right along with her. from that first memorable encounter, when he demonstrates what a `tell' is and how it works, to the lessons of the `short con,' to the stunning climax of this film, mamet keeps the con going with an urgency that is relentless. and nothing is what it seems. in the end, margaret learns some hard lessons about life and human nature, and about herself. she changes; and whether or not it's for the better is open to speculation. mantegna is absolutely riveting in this film; he lends every nuance possible to a complex character who must be able to lead you willingly into the shadows, and does. crouse also turns in an outstanding performance here; you feel the rigid, up-tight turmoil roiling beneath that calm, self-assured exterior, and when her experiences with mike induce the change in her, she makes you feel how deeply it has penetrated. she makes you believe that she is capable of what she does, and makes you understand it, as well. the dynamic supporting cast includes mike nussbaum (joey), lilia skala (dr. littauer), j.t. walsh (the businessman), ricky jay (george) and william h. macy (sergeant moran). `house of games' is the quintessential mamet; he's written and directed a number of high-caliber plays and films since, and will no doubt grace us with more in the future. but this film will be the one that defines him; and you can go to the dictionary and look it up. you'll find it under `perfection.' this is one great movie you do not want to miss. i rate this one 10/10.\",\n",

              " \"starring: jim carrey, morgan freeman, jennifer anniston i was really quite skeptical the first time i watched this movie. i mean, what a conceptual nightmare. jim carrey playing god? nothing is sacred anymore. well, this movie is hardly sacred, but it also is not sacrilegious, at least not to any great extent. yes, jim carrey has the powers of god for a while, but he is not god. confused? i'll give you the low down. jim carrey plays bruce nolan, a reporter who is down on his luck and feeling very unsuccessful with his life. he lives with his beautiful girlfriend, grace (anniston), and you can tell right off the bat that they love each other, but the relationship is on fairly shaky ground. then bruce gets a shot at anchorman, only to have it underhandedly stolen by evan baxter. obviously not please, bruce shares his thoughts with the world through the television in a way which is comical and definitely worthy of getting him fired. much complaining and griping about god later, bruce gets a page. after a while he gets tired of it calling, so he responds and goes to the omni presents building (heh). there he meets god (freeman), who is the boss, electrician, and janitor of the building. i found this highly amusing. god is the boss, the holy spirit is the electrician, and jesus christ is the janitor. think about it. boss, obvious. electrician, the guy who keeps everything running. janitor, the guy who cleans up the mess that the world has left. brilliant. anyway, bruce is a little skeptical about having actually met god, but when god gives bruce his powers and gives him a shot at playing god, he starts to believe a bit. wonder why. enter the flagrant abuse of powers for personal gain and to abuse the enemies. since this is hollywood, bruce obviously eventually smartens up, learns his lesson, and starts using his powers for the good of the world. in the end he cries out for god to take it away and prays that his will be done, not bruce's. since it is jim carrey, the movie is quite amusing, and there are definitely some highly entertaining moments in it. the movie is not perfect theology, but for hollywood, it is definitely a good attempt. many statements in the film can be quite thought provoking and even challenging, and i applaud tom shadyac for his effort in this movie. so, while far from perfect, definitely an amusing popcorn movie with a little bit of thought behind it. bottom line: 3.5 out of 4 (worth a view or two)\",\n",
              " \"jim carrey is back to much the same role that he played in the mask, a timid guy who is trying to get ahead in the world but who seems to be plagued with bad luck. even when he tries to help a homeless guy from being harassed by a bunch of hoodlums (and of course they have to be mexican, obviously), his good will towards his fellow man backfires. in that case, it wasn't too hard to predict that he was about to have a handful of angry hoodlums, but i like that the movie suggests that things like that shouldn't be ignored. i'm reminded of the episode of michael moore's brilliant the awful truth, when they had a man lay down on the sidewalk and pretend to be dead and see who would actually stop and make sure he was okay. the results were not very promising, so it's nice to see someone in the movies setting a good example. jim carrey plays the part of bruce nolan, the nice guy mentioned above whose entire life seems to be falling apart. or even better, it seems to be breaking up by the blows of bad luck like an asteroid entering the atmosphere (a little metaphor that comes up when bruce miraculously finds himself a gigantic news story later in the film). bruce is nearly 40 years old and all he has to show for it is a position as a news reporter of the sort that reports on such exciting news as the local bakery that's seeking to bake the world's biggest cookie. he's desperate to obtain the job of head anchor at the tv station, but he loses his cool on live tv when he hears that the job went to his rival colleague. you have to love how they time the revelation of this news to him seconds before his first live report. needless to say, he loses his temper on live tv in one of the funniest scenes of the entire film. morgan freeman delivers a fantastic performance as the man himself, displaying a god whose infinite wisdom is somewhat reflected through freeman's massive talent as an actor. he is the kind of god who takes his job very seriously, but in such a way as to advise his followers (as well as the viewers of this movie) that there are times when you need to slow down and do some manual labor in life. i love his line that some of the happiest people in the world come home smelling to high heaven at the end of the day. there are a lot of people in the world (maybe more than our share in america) who are so absorbed by their money and their possessions and their jobs and everything that they completely lost touch with the natural side of themselves as humans. one of the biggest strengths is that the movie is able to provide great advice to people in general about improving their lives, and this message is clear and acceptable regardless of the viewer's religion. i, for example, tend to reject organized religion in all forms and i see god and satan to be metaphors for different aspects of nature and human psychology rather than actual figures who ever lived or continue to live. but despite the fact that i don't believe that god exists as an entity overseeing the universe or as a janitor dressed all in white who mops the floors of his downtown office in his spare time, i was able to appreciate the messages that were delivered in this movie. jim carrey's movies display this fantastic evolution that ties them all together and makes the newer ones look even better just because you can see how far he's come. if you compare bruce almighty with movies like ace ventura (both of which i loved, by the way) or a lot of what he did before he got into film, it's amazing how far he's come. he has moved from cheesy tv comedy to cheesy comedic films to comedies that are truly intelligent and meaningful like this film as well as others like the truman show, man on the moon, and the majestic (easily one of his greatest films ever). jim carrey has unmistakably moved from the cheesy comedy of his past to become one of the most important comic actors working today. jennifer aniston also once again provides an excellent addition to the movie (as she did in the side-splitting office space) as bruce's girlfriend, who becomes increasingly exasperated by bruce's growing stress about his life as well as his negligence to ask her to marry him. there is definitely some low-brow comedy in the film that doesn't really fit with the importance of the film's meaning or the quality of the delivery, such as the dog reading the newspaper on the toilet and the whole monkey scene, but it was definitely pretty nice to see ace ventura's friend spike make a cameo appearance. as stephen king very well knows, it's always nice to see familiar characters. it's almost like seeing family again. bruce is endowed with the powers of god for a given period of time so that he can understand life a bit better, and he says a lot about himself when he uses the powers only for his own purposes rather than to help all of the people who pray to him. the thing i love about this is that, like i said before, religion is absent from my life, but i was able to watch this and learn a lot about myself as well by thinking about what kinds of things i would have done had i been endowed with such powers. the movie allows us to learn vicariously this way, which empowers the message even more. the scenes that involve the news station are easily the funniest in the entire film, such as the scene when bruce loses his temper about the anchor position, the jimmy hoffa scene (who was conveniently buried with an original birth certificate and a complete set of dental records), the scene where bruce's rival colleague is made to go nuts on camera, and my favorites, the ones at the beginning and the end involving the local bakery's cooking. the movie has plenty of time for carrey to deliver some excellent jokes, such as when he says to god (who reveals that he's the janitor, the proprietor, the electrician, etc) that his christmas parties must be real bashes, and to be careful about drinking, because on of him might need a ride home! i also loved the end when he says that behind every great man is a woman rolling her eyes. a little too true, and as gallagher would add, behind every great man is also an amazed mother-in-law. bruce almighty is one of the more memorable comedies to have come out for quite a while, and is probably the only directly religious that i can remember seeing that i am anxious to buy on dvd to add to my personal collection. it is a comedy written and performed in good taste, but with enough relatively low-brow humor to keep the kids entertained. this is a meaningful comedy for the whole family, which is becoming rarer and rarer these days. in a world that is about to be flogged with yet another american pie film and another scary movie (which are only scary because of their sheer barbarous idiocy), it's nice to see that there are still people making comedies worth watching. don't miss this one.\",\n",

              " 'it has said that the movies and baseball both thrived during the great depression. it appears that the grim realities of a nation caught up in the aftermath of this economic disaster created a need for occasional relief for the populace. a temporary escape could be found in the on going soap opera that is baseball. likewise, an occasional excursion of 2 or 3 hours into the darkened auditoriums of the cinema. the presence of a radio in just about everyone\\'s house hold kept depression era america at once attuned to world\\'s events and provided many a drama and (especially) comedy shows for a pleasant interlude from harsh reality. the literature of the time also flourished at all levels. the juvenile reading habits helped to create the comic book as we know it, what with all the fantastic characters and super exciting adventures. but the comic book just did not magically appear, all fully developed with all the colorful 4 color pages, all by itself. there were mediums that were ancestral to them. obviously,the newspaper comic strip was one parent, providing the visual/narrative method of story telling. the other direct ancestor was the pulp magazine. the inexpensive, prose story publications that carried a great deal of stories of the same adventure characters in on going, though not necessarily serialized, tales. the pulp medium had been around for some decades and introduced us to edgar rice borrough\\'s tarzan and johnston mcculley\\'s zorro. the 1930\\'s brought forth a bumper crop as feature characters like the shadow, the avenger, g8\\'s battle aces and the spider,master of men all found their way to the news stands, among many others. one other was doc savage, a full-blooded super hero of the written story; the covers of the pulps had perhaps, the only \"picture\" of the hero. possessing extraordinary strength, super keen senses and a protean genius class intellect, doc was the prototype super hero. he also assembled 5 of his former army buddies into a small, free lancing team of adventurers. each of them was an expert in a given field. so we had a top rated: chemist, lawyer, construction engineer, electrical engineer, geologist-archaeologist-paleontologist, etc. the doc savage stories were very popular in the 1930\\'s and \\'40\\'s, and were published into the middle \\'50\\'s. then they went into a hiatus for a good 12-15 years. then the brainstorm came about to repackage the old novels in new \"container\", the paperback book. a fresh look to the cover art was introduced, featuring a highly stylized series of paintings of a very muscular doc, with a perpetually ripped shirt. the re-introduction proved to be highly successful, with the publication of a title a month (and for a while more). soon, there was a rumor of a doc savage movie! but when, by what producer? well, the venerable \"man of bronze\" was back on the news stands for over 10 years before any real project got put together. it was veteran stop-action animator and producer of top special effects films, geoprge pal, who did the film along with warner brothers. when doc savage, man of bronze arrived in the movie houses, it boasted of a well casted team of actors, albeit a largely \"no name\" as far familiarity with the viewers. with former tarzan of tv,ron ely\\'s nearly perfect casting in the lead, up and coming beauty of a starlette, pamela hensley in the female lead and veteran character paul wexler (as the villainous, captain seas); no other name would have been recognized. and, just maybe that was a plus in this case. the story does a fine job of both getting most of the audience acquainted with the incredible group and at the same time get a plot going. use of narration, by paul frees, and short film clips are the method pursued to move the introduction along to the main body of the story. from the very start, there are hints that this story will go with the same sort of manufactured \"camp\" humor as the batman tv series. some really great looking early scenes involving doc and the whole crew doing their individual specialties are thrown toward humor by the paul frees narration and the unexpected, unlikely outcomes. (for example, an experiment of doc\\'s with a miniature rocket/missile turns out to be part of a method of catching fish, a small one at that.) the whole story unfolds like that, hitting the viewer with a little \\'camp\\' every so often, as to keep reminding us not to take it too seriously. we are also puzzled about mr. george pal\\'s being the producer(his last). he who had been so well known for special effects, surely a factor that could be put to good use in a sci-fi action setting of the pulp character\\'s world. i can remember seeing it quite vividly. mrs. ryan (deanna) was in the hospital, just having given birth to our 2nd child, michelle(08/14/75). our older girl, jennifer, was visiting her grandmother, so after visiting hours were over in the maternity ward, it was straight over to the old marquette theatre, 63rd & kedzie, here in chicago. having seen it and being a guy with a good familiarity with doc, i was sort of let down by the final product. i could accept a little of this \\'camp\\' business, but would not have objected if mr.pal would have seen fit to let it all hang out and have some real neat dinosaurs and volcanoes to give it all a little more pulp/comic/serial type excitement. and yet, the cast, headed-up by mr. ely and the others, made the whole film likable, if not lovable. the sets and locations were, as far as we can see, very much like those of a \\'30\\'s serial or adventure flick which would be enjoyable to about anyone. and maybe that\\'s just what they were trying for with this doc savage, man of bronze.',\n",

they don\\'t seem to have any rapport, and norman has no qualms whatsoever about kicking garson out, and even when he comes around to stand up for himself, he never defends garson or talks about their relationship. there were some kind of sweetly quaint touches like rf going to buy all those books on homosexuality-\\x97and sitting right down on the park bench to read them! i like the idea that a parent would actually try to find something out about homosexuality, rather than just run off to get drunk or commiserate with his friends. other than that, it\\'s kind of just what it seems like: a little relic of a bygone era, an era in which some gay people thought that if uptight straight people just sat down and watched a drag marionette performance, we could all learn to love and understand one another! and because of the whole naiveté of this thing, the extreme stereotypes and message-laden dialogue just come off as charmingly outdated, and provide a great deal of grist for discussion on how things have changed for gays in the past 30 years. i guess the only thing that seems offensive is the idea that gays\\' female friends are desperately in love with them, and are willing to get them drunk in order to sleep with, and by extension convert, them. ------ hey, check out cinema de merde, my website on bad and cheesy movies (with a few good movies thrown in). you can find the url in my email address above.',\n",

              " 'in august 1980 the disappearance of baby azaria chamberlain and the pursuant trial of her parents lindy and michael for the alleged murder of the child caused an uproar across what was then a very angry nation. the media and the public had already tried and convicted the accused couple and were baying for blood. what followed was a gross miscarriage of justice. michael and lindy chamberlain claimed that while camping near ayers rock, central australia, that a dingo had taken their ten week old daughter from their tent as they were preparing to eat in the barbecue area. no-one believed them. lindy was charged with the murder of her baby, and michael as an accessory after the fact. the whole country was abuzz with whispers of a ritual killing. the chamberlain\\'s trial was over before it began. lindy never proved her innocence, so she was found guilty. there was never enough evidence to convict her, yet the jury was swayed by public and media pressure. how could we as a nation even sit in judgement? from where we are, how could we possibly presume to know? unless there was absolute proof, and no reasonable doubt whatsoever, the chamberlains should have been acquitted. fred schepisi\\'s film unequivocally and whole heartedly supports the argument of john bryson\\'s novel, that the chamberlains were completely innocent of the charges laid against them. that in fact a dingo did take baby azaria on that fateful night at ayers rock. schepisi has brilliantly captured the mood of a blood thirsty nation, hell bent on \\'the truth\\' being brought to light. he shows australia in a rather unbecoming light as a people who were totally obsessed with seeing the chamberlains pay! his screenplay, co-written with robert caswell, vigorously stirs the emotions and will most certainly find the audience saddened and angered at the travesty of justice which occurred. the outstanding meryl streep gives an incredible performance as the woman accused of the most dreadful of acts. she brings to life most convincingly the tough little aussie who was ready to stand up to the allegations and set the world straight. even her accent is almost, but not quite, spot on. a very good effort by the master of that trade. sam neill is every bit as good as streep as the at first faithful but then disillusioned michael who cannot comprehend why their world is falling apart, and he starts to question his christianity. his, as was streep\\'s, is a showing of great emotional strength that will move you profoundly. the entire support cast are also excellent, with some of australia\\'s finest actors and actresses playing a part. technically the film is brilliant too, with director of photography ian baker capturing this great land with splendour (especially the rock). editor jill bilcock keeps the whole movie tense and very emotionally charged, while bruce smeaton provides a telling score. for all aussies this is a must see, a shocking look in the mirror if you will, at what we as a country did to a family who just wanted justice to be served, and the truth to be known. as michael chamberlain said : \"i don\\'t think anybody really understands what innocence means.....to innocent people.\" saturday, may 20, 1995 - video even on return viewings fred schepisi\\'s account of the travesty of justice that befell the chamberlains, who lost baby azaria at ayres rock in 1980, is still emotionally powerful and honestly moving. schepisi and robert caswell have expertly transferred john bryson\\'s novel to the screen, telling with simplicity the horrifying story of a vacation gone terribly wrong for michael and lindy chamberlain, whose new born daughter azaria was taken form the family tent by a dingo just moments after being put down. amid media speculation and vicious public rumour lindy was charged with the murder of her baby, and michael was charged as an accessory after the fact. what followed was little more than trial by media, and with the australian people determined she be put away, lindy was found guilty and sentenced to life imprisonment with hard labour, even though the prosecution could present no motive and little other than circumstantial evidence. meryl streep is in top form as the accused woman who battles australia head on to prove her innocence. she is truly awesome, and the only thing that fails her is a true blue aussie accent, though she does her level best to sound ocker. you might wonder why a top australian actress wasn\\'t cast in the role, but star power is probably the answer. alongside meryl is an equally impressive sam neill, outstanding as the husband who sees his world falling apart before his eyes, while he feels powerless to do anything about it. a strong aussie cast lend compelling support. editing from jill bilcock is very timely, ian baker\\'s cinematography of the rock and other rugged locations is visually brilliant and bruce smeaton\\'s music is perfect for the part. truly a must for all conscientious australians. sunday, june 15, 1996 - video',\n",
              " \"i found it hard to like anyone in this film. the central characters, lindy and michael chamberlain, whose daughter disappears during a night out in the australian outback, are not bad people, but then surely not all, or even most, of the scores of people we see throughout this movie would be bad if we knew them better. but though we are as sure as the film wants us to be of the guilt or innocence of the chamberlains from the start of their life's tragic disarray, the film takes on a more or less sociological perspective pertaining to gossip, news media, crowds, mobs and assumptions. it's not a movie about the degenerate society of australia in particular; it's merely an account of a true story that happened there. society en masse is much less evolved than the individual feels ensured that we are. when a warden insists upon killing all of an aborigine's dogs because of the unverified action of a single wild dog, when a randomly ruined life spins even further out of control owing to the majority of magazines, newspapers and tv programs distorts the tragic truth to a level of drama that provokes its consumers into a frenzy, there is no sign of empathy or even any kind of looking outside of one's own unaware perceptions, influenced left and right by the vigorous hearsay and vibes of those who surround one's life. the reason i appreciate the film is because it turns the focus inside out, from the victims to the masses. the evidence against lindy chamberlain aside, suspicion was jet-fueled mostly by a virtue of hers. to the public eye, she did not seem sufficiently distraught by the death of her baby daughter. why was she able to keep her cool, even a sort of aloofness let alone holding her head up, for tv and the press? how much of the downward spiral could've been prevented had she behaved more to the public's liking in the media? meryl streep, one of, if not the, greatest actress working today, may not give a performance that particularly stands out, and frankly neither does any other actor, or department of film-making. but she, and the screenwriters, do understand lindy. what is infuriating is that it's not that difficult. apparently, she was not naturally prone to showing emotion in public in any case. whether or not she is approachable as a lovable character in the immediate sense, we are naturally prone to sympathize with her situation. whether or not her performance is as immediately gratifying as sophie's choice, the devil wears prada, angels in america or other such work, it is a triumph. it is difficult enrapture an audience when you purposely deny them insights into yourself. she frustrates us because we don't know what she's thinking or feeling. it took me awhile to feel endeared toward her, but this is the movie's way of suggesting the reaction of the public's attention. she is married to a pastor, and they both practice a religion that is in a small minority and thus misinterpreted by most. initially, they react to their loss as if to be reconciling themselves to god's will, kick-starting a rumor mill generating the notion that their daughter's death was some sort of ritual killing on their part. whatever happened to the little girl, her parents were part of a margin with whom most of the media's intake didn't immediately identify, so the first inclination was to go after them like a pack of hungry...well... meryl streep and sam neill are constantly on screen, but the australian public plays the real leads here. like punctuation for each plot advance, director fred schepisi cuts away from restaurant to tennis court to dinner party to saloon to office, where the public tries lindy and gets carried away into their own passionate projections. this golan-globus docudrama is not particularly memorable. the setting's atmosphere doesn't give a pleasurable enough compensation for the fact that no performance or facet of production stands out. but it is very successful as an indictment of the collective conscious of the public.\",\n",
              " 'i remember seeing this movie shown several years ago on the lifetime tv network and thought it was an interesting story. several years later i see it again and fall head over heels in love with this movie. the story behind the movie is fascinating in and of itself. the cast just makes it that much more appealing. meryl streep is definitely at the top of her game in this picture. she nails mrs. chamberlain\\'s mannerisms, the accent, and even look. she shows the pain, hurt, surprise, and anger that lindy had to endure, and in the process it\\'s hard to remember that it isn\\'t lindy. in my opinion, this performance of meryl\\'s was better than her oscar-winning turn in \"sophie\\'s choice\", and should have garnered her her third oscar. sam neill is perfect as michael chamberlain, and for some surprising reason, wasn\\'t recognized by the academy with at least a nomination. in all, this movie only receive one oscar nod (streep\\'s for best actress.) however, it did receive several australian oscars and nominations. definitely a top-rate movie: it tells a great story and you get great performances from the entire cast.',\n",

              " 'this is a docudrama story on the lindy chamberlain case and a look at it\\'s impact on australian society. it especially looks at the problem of innuendo, gossip and expectation when dealing with real-life dramas. one issue the story deals with is the way it is expected people will all give the same emotional response to similar situations. not everyone goes into wild melodramatic hysterics to every major crisis. just because the characters in the movies and on tv act in a certain way is no reason to expect real people to do so. this is especially apt for journalists and news editors who appear to be looking for the the big sob scene that will pull the ratings. it\\'s an issue that has to be constantly addressed. the leads play the characters with depth, personality and sensitivity. and they are ably supported by a large cast all playing based-on-fact individuals. some viewers may be surprised to learn that many of the supporting cast in this story are people better known in australia as comic actors. it re-enforces my idea that comic actors make some of the best supports in dramas because with comedy they know how to establish quick impressions of individuals. (spoiler warning!) i have to say something very personal here; in that i am actually an ex-adventist who was a practicing member in australia at the time this incident occurred; so i have a slightly different impression of the story than most. i think it is handled with amazing creativity and personality, and emotional heart. i think the best scene is the one where the couple are hounded by the new choppers. it captured the themes of the story brilliantly. i once heard fred schepsi say in an interview that he told the actors to \"play the best case for their character they could\". while this is especially apt for this story, i think it is also a general principle that should apply to all acting as well.',\n",

              " 'meryl streep is excellent in her nuanced and stoic performance as the infamous lindy chamberlain who was accused and tried for allegedly killing her own baby azaria chamberlain and using her alibi of ravenous dingoes as her defense. based on the book \"evil angels\" and titled so in its australian release, a cry in the dark is an ugly film to watch. it presents a scenario that\\'s all too real for us in america: the witch-hunt against a person deemed an easy target. lindy chamberlain was this woman. being someone who spoke her mind, someone who didn\\'t play the sympathy card, and someone who was just tough enough to move on with her life despite her horrific ordeal, she was labeled as suspect and hated beyond comprehension even when it was clear she didn\\'t kill her own child. the media began a tightening noose and a progressive invasion of privacy that soon had the entire nation glued to their sets as they eviscerated this family piece by piece. and through it all, lindy remained as stoic as ever, even when her husband michael was falling apart. this stance, of course, is the power of strength, as unsympathetic as it may look like, and people happen to react strongly to that. they want to see a distressed mother cry and weep and occasionally faint at every turn, not sit there and look blank. people don\\'t understand that not everyone grieves the same way and when someone decides to stand strong they begin speculations. meryl streep embodies this tainted woman to the hilt and in doing so creates a cold, but not unfeeling woman, one that stood by her convictions even if they cost her liberty. because of her, sam neill is allowed to have his character slowly dissolve into despair -- someone has to, or the chamberlains would be too detached, and no one wants to see that. except the monster that has at the time of this writing become the news-media. they\\'ll always eat train wrecks up and feed the mangled manure to the uninformed public.',\n",
              " 'spoilers following: i picked up the book \"evil angels\" when it first came out knowing nothing of the case. just to give the press and the austrialian people a break here, i was quite far into it before i began to question the chamberlain\\'s guilt. the author obviously intended the reader to understand why the public jumped to the conclusions they did. john bryson told the story just as it was presented to the jurors (and picked up by the press) of the arterial spray, the actelone (??) plates, dr. james cameron\\'s certainty that the collar was cut with scissors, that a baby could not be taken whole from her clothes with the buttons still done up, bloody hand print, etc. all quite convincingly. after all, these were experts in their fields who were testifying with no apparent reason to lie, and the fact that the evidence was completely wrong wasn\\'t apparent to me at all. it was also highly technical evidence, difficult for a layman to understand. to this point, beyond some hearsay testimony in the trials, hardly anyone had ever heard of a dingo attacking a human; people didn\\'t believe it was possible. the public was suspicious of the seventh day adventists, whose origins made them appear to be a cult, and all sorts of wild beliefs about them contributed to the appearance of guilt. were it not for dedicated, selfless lawyers who worked relentlessly to investigate and counter the trial testimony, finding azaria\\'s clothes later would not have been enough to get lindy out of jail. the book shook me for that reason, and i\\'ve been reluctant to come to a conclusion about anyone\\'s guilt ever since (excepting oj of course). i was thrilled that a movie was going to be made about the case and don\\'t think it could have been done better. i\\'ve always liked sam, who i could identify with completely, and meryl was perfect as always. beautiful photography, haunting music. i think it\\'s not only a very good, but a very important, movie. too bad it didn\\'t receive more publicity at the time it was released.',\n",

              " \"the making of the thief of bagdad is quite a story unto itself, almost as wondrous as the tale told in this film. alexander korda nearly went broke making this film. according to the citadel film series book about the great british films, adopted son of the united kingdom alexander korda had conceived this film as early as 1933 and spent years of planning and preparation. but world war ii unfortunately caught up with korda and the mounting expenses of filming a grand spectacle. budget costs happen in us films too, only cecil b. demille always had a free hand at paramount after 1932 when he returned there. but demille nor any of his american contemporaries had to worry about enemy bombs while shooting the film. part of the way through the shoot, korda transported the whole company to america and shot those sequences with rex ingram as the genie in our grand canyon. he certainly wasn't going to get scenery like that in the uk. korda also finished the interiors in hollywood, all in time for a release on christmas day 1940. the spectacle of the thing earned the thief of bagdad four academy award nominations and three oscars for best color cinematography, best art&set direction for a color film, and best special effects. only miklos rosza's original musical score did not take home a prize in a nominated category. korda must have been real happy about deciding to shoot in the grand canyon because it's impossible to get bad color pictures from that place. the special effects however do not overwhelm the simple story of good triumphing over evil. the good is the two young lovers john justin and june duprez and the evil is conrad veidt as the sorcerer who tries to steal both a kingdom and a heart, both belonging to duprez. this was veidt's career role until casablanca where he played the luftwaffe major stroesser. of course good gets a little help from an unlikely source. beggar boy and thief sabu who may very well have been one of the few who could call himself at the time an international movie star. literally rising from poverty working as an elephant stable boy for the maharajah of mysore he was spotted by alexander korda who needed a native lead for one of his jungle features. sabu captures all the innocence and mischievousness of youth as he fulfills the arabian nights fantasy of the boy who topples a tyrant. not a bad message to be sending out in 1940 at that. the thief of bagdad holds up remarkably well today. it's an eternal tale of love, romance, and adventure in any order you want to put it.\",\n",

              " 'the story-line of \"the thief of bagdad\" is complex, owing to its being told in flashbacks and having three separate and equally important strands woven together. the screenplay by lajo biros and the dialogue by miles malleson keep the story moving skillfully at all points.the young king ahmad of bagdad is angry at his vizier jaffar for executing a man for having different ideas. he discovers while in disguise that people blame him for jaffar\\'s deeds and hate him. he is imprisoned by jaffar, where he meets abu the young thief. the two escape and take a boat to the city of basra. there the companions spy when men clear the way so none will see the princess of the city passing by. ahmad falls in love with her and visits her in her garden. he tells her he has come to her from beyond time and wins a kiss. then he is captured. when jaffar comes to win the princess of basra for himself, ahmad attacks the evil vizier who blinds him and turns abu into a dog. jaffar then asks for the princess\\'s hand, and he gives the gift of a mechanical flying horse to the sultan of basra. the blind ahmad then tells his tale in the marketplace, accompanied by abu as his dog. the prince has fallen into a sleep and nothing can wake her. so jaffar sends his servant halima for ahmad and the dog, in hopes the prince can rouse her. he does awaken her. she boards a ship to find a doctor to cure ahmad, but she is captured by jaffar who then throws the dog overboard. she then allows jaffar to take her in his arms, on his promise to restore ahmad\\'s sight and turn abu back into a thief. the princess sees a vision of ahmad; he is in a boat; jaffar sends a storm to beset him and abu is shipwrecked on a deserted island. abu finds a genie or djinn who wants to kill him now that he is free after many centuries spent imprisoned in a bottle. abu tricks him into proving he really came from so small a vessel, then corks him in again. for freeing him, he gets three wishes. his first is for sausages. in the meanwhile, the princess pleads with her father to refuse jaffar; but jaffar shows the sultan a new mechanical toy, one of whose six arms stabs him to death. abu makes a second wish, to find ahmad. the cunning genie flies him to the goddess of the all-seeing eye. abu has to climb a great web to get to the gem that is the eye, battling a giant spider, then scaling the goddess\\'s statue. abu gazes into the \\'eye\\' and sees ahmad in a canyon. he has the genie take him to ahmad. ahmad uses the eye to see the princess. she smells a flower and forgets everything at once. abu wishes they were in bagdad, but the genie laughs and leaves; jaffar tells the princess that she is in love with him, omitting mention of ahmad. ahmad tries to fight his way to the princess, but jaffar smashes the \\'eye\\'. abu finds himself in the \"land of legend\", where the old men who rule want to make him their king. he steals a bow and a magic carpet and escapes instead, to hurry to save ahmad and the princess. the thief arrives in time to save the young king from the executioner, using his bow from the flying carpet, to the wonder of the throng who had come to watch the execution. jaffar tries to flee on the mechanical flying horse, but another shot from the bow finishes him. ahmad is ruler again and plans to wed his princess; but when he tries to make abu his vizier, the young thief refuses, saying that what he wants is adventure, not hard work and confinement in a palace however grand it may be. this fantastic story was given a sumptuous production by producer alexander korda. the production was designed by vincent korda who was also art director, while georges perinal did the colorful cinematography. the directors credited are ludwig berger and michael powell, with tim whelan, alexander korda, william cameron menzies and zoltan korda participating. the extraordinary and numerous costumes designs were the work of john armstrong, oliver messel and marcel vertes. the production, apart from its gorgeous and expensive-looking visual splendors, i claim is dominated by two other elements, the choral music of miklos rozsa and the performance by conrad veidt as the evil jaffar. rex ingram plays the genie with a curious accent, plus his usual intelligence and power. june duprez is lovely and effective as the princess mary morris is a sad and beautiful halima, and miles malleson a properly bumbling and avaricious sultan. as ahmad, john justin appears to do most of what can be done with the part of a young prince in love and then some; he is memorably good in his winning role. this film has a spaciousness about it that is found, i assert, in other korda works also. its imaginative content stands in contrast to very-strong realistic sets, costumes and set-design elements. this is one of the most memorable idea-level fantasies of all time, worthy to be enjoyed over and over.',\n",

              " \"watch on the rhine started as a broadway play by lillian hellman who wrote the film and saw it open on broadway at a time when the soviet union was still bound to nazi germany by that infamous non-aggression pact signed in august of 1939. so much for the fact that hellman was merely echoing the communist party line, the line didn't change until a couple of months later. lillian was actually months ahead of her time with this work. the play watch on the rhine ran from april 1941 to february 1942 for 378 performances and five players came over from broadway to repeat their roles frank wilson as the butler, eric roberts as the youngest son, lucile watson as the family matriarch and most importantly villain george coulouris and paul lukas. lukas pulled an award hat trick in 1943 winning an oscar, a golden globe, and the new york film critics for best actor. probably if the tony awards had been in existence then he would have won that as well. the oscar is even more remarkable when you consider who he was up against, humphrey bogart for casablanca, gary cooper in for whom the bell tolls, mickey rooney in the human comedy, and walter pidgeon for madame curie. every one of his competitors was a bigger box office movie name than he was. lukas's nomination is usually the kind the academy gives to round out a field. jack warner knew that which is why mady christians did not repeat her broadway part and the role of lukas's wife was given to bette davis. davis took the part not because this was an especially showy role for her, but because she believed in the picture and just wanted to be associated with it. it's the same reason she did the man who came to dinner, a much lighter play than this one. davis is the daughter of a late american supreme court justice who married a german national back in the weimar days. after many years of being vagabonds on the continent of europe, davis lukas, and their three children come to america which has not yet entered the european war. they're made welcome by lucile watson who is thrilled naturally at finally meeting her grandchildren. the fly in this ointment are some other house guests, a friend of davis's from bygone days geraldine fitzgerald and her husband who is also from europe, a rumanian diplomat and aristocrat george coulouris. coulouris is a wastrel and a spendthrift and he smells an opportunity for double dealing when he suspects lukas's anti-fascist background. his suspicions are quite correct, it's the reason that the family has been the vagabonds they've become. lukas fought in spain on the republican side and was wounded there. his health has not been the same since. his family loyally supports him in whatever decision he makes. those decisions affect all the other members of the cast. adding quite a bit more to the broadway play including some lovely fascist creatures was dashiell hammett who was lillian hellman's significant other. coulouris playing cards at the german embassy was a hammett creation with such loathsome types as henry daniell, kurt katch, clyde fillmore, erwin kalser and rudolph anders. coulouris is truly one of the most despicable characters ever brought to screen as the no account runmanian count. he was a metaphor for his own country who embraced the nazis with gusto and then equally repudiated them without losing a step after stalingrad. lucile watson was up for best supporting actress in 1943, but lost to katina paxinou in for whom the bell tolls. dashiell hammett was nominated for best adapted screenplay and the film itself lost for best picture to that other anti-fascist classic, casablanca. though it's an item firmly planted in those specific times, watch on the rhine still packs a stern anti-fascist message that bears repeating infinitely.\",\n",

(it must be admitted that the second half doesn't quite live up to the promise of the first.) like the arabian nights it tries to cram as many middle-eastern folk motiffs as possible into the one work. a freed genie, a beautiful princess, a flying carpet, fantastic mechanical toys, sea voyages, a crowded marketplace, a wicked vizier, jewels ... i don't know why it all works, but it does. everything is just so beautiful. the sets are beautiful. june duprez is beautiful. rozsa's score is especially beautiful. as usual, it sounds hungarian; but somehow he manages to convince us that he's being hungarian in a persian way.\",\n",

(howard, incidentally, did the special effects for the 1961 version of this film. both men had long and distinguished careers in technical wizardry.) duprez is outstandingly lovely while little called on for serious acting. justin\\'s ahmad projects a driven but dreamy romanticism untouched by erotic impulses. sabu is really the central actor in many scenes and he\\'s very good. for a movie meant for kids as well as adults there\\'s a fair amount of violence but of the bloodless kind. still, i don\\'t think anyone under eight ought to see \"thief of bagdad.\" this film makes periodic appearances on tv but today my teenage son and i saw it in a theater with quite a few youngsters present. it was great to see computer-besotted kids in an affluent community respond with cheers and applause to special effects that must seem primitive to them. \"thief of bagdad\" is a pre-war hollywood classic from a time when strong production values often resulted in enduringly attractive and important releases. this is one of the best of its kind. 9/10.',\n",

              " 'mario lanza, of course, is \"the great caruso\" in this 1951 film also starring ann blyth, dorothy kirsten, eduard franz and ludwig donath. this is a highly fictionalized biography of the legendary, world-renowned tenor whose name is known even today. the film is opulently produced, and the music is glorious and beautifully sung by lanza, kirsten, judmila novotna, blanche thebom, and other opera stars who appeared in the film. if you\\'re a purist, seeing people on stage smiling during the sextet from \"lucia\" will strike you as odd - even if caruso\\'s wife dorothy just had a baby girl. also it\\'s highly unlikely that caruso ever sang edgardo in lucia; the role lay too high for him. in taking dramatic license, the script leaves out some very dramatic parts of caruso\\'s life. what was so remarkable about him is that he actually created roles in operas that are today in the standard repertoire, yet this is never mentioned in the film. these roles include maurizio in adriana lecouvreur and dick johnson in \"girl of the golden west,\" there is a famous photo of him posing with a sheet wrapped around him like a toga. the reason for that photo? his only shirt was in the laundry. he was one of the pioneers of recorded music and had a long partnership with the victor talking-machine company (later rca victor). he was singing jose in carmen in san francisco the night of the earthquake. instead, the mgm story basically has him dying on stage during a performance of martha, which never happened. he had a hemorrhage during \"l\\'elisir d\\'amore\" at the met and could not finish the performance; he only sang three more times at the met, his last role as eleazar in la juive. what killed him? the same thing that killed valentino - peritonitis. his first role at the met was not radames in aida, as indicated in the film, but the duke in rigoletto. so when it says on the screen \"suggested by dorothy caruso\\'s biography of her husband,\" that\\'s what it was - suggested. what is true is that dorothy\\'s father disowned her after her marriage, and left her $1 of his massive estate. they also did have a daughter gloria together (who died at the age of 79 on 10/7/2007). however, caruso had four other children by a mistress before he married dorothy. some people say that lanza\\'s voice is remarkably like caruso\\'s, but just listen to caruso sing in the film \"match point\" -- caruso\\'s voice is remarkably unlike lanza\\'s. in fact, from his sound, had he wanted to, caruso could have sung as a baritone. he is thought to have had some trouble with high notes, further evidence of baritone leanings; and the role he was preparing when he died was othello, a dramatic tenor role, which lanza definitely was not. lanza\\'s voice deserved not to be compared with another. he made a unique contribution to film history, popularizing operatic music. he sings the music in \"the great caruso\" with a robust energy; he is truly here at the peak of what would be a short career. his acting is natural and genuine. ann blyth is lovely as dorothy and gets to sing a little herself. really a film for opera lovers and lanza fans, which are probably one and the same.',\n",

              " 'after a chance encounter on the train, a young couple spends a single night strolling the streets of vienna, discussing life and love. the primary reason to see \"before sunrise,\" is to watch a young julie delpy deliver her lines. as \"celine,\" this sexy, brainy, soulful brown-eyed blond is sort of a cross between brigitte bardot and joni mitchell as they were in their mid-twenties. risking overstatement, celine is practically the ideal woman, unusually beautiful and very feminine while being natural, unpretentious, introspective, and selflessly loving. we can easily forgive that she is a bit eccentric and talks a blue streak, for her sincere, intelligent remarks are occasionally penetrating. further, her varied expressions are nothing short of captivating and she speaks english with a french accent that is very endearing. if there is a fly in the ointment of this good movie, it would have to be her unkempt and disheveled costar. ethan hawke as \"jessie\" comes off like a vaguely appealing slob, sort of a maynard g. krebs of the nineties. attempting to appear detached and nonchalant, he sort of drags himself through certain shots. his pants fit poorly, his tee shirt is coming untucked, his wavy dark hair (his most attractive feature) needs a good washing, and someone really should have showed him how to properly trim his youthful goatee. nevertheless, he is supposed to represent an unwashed youth on a two-week train ride around europe, so the look he has cultivated is probably pretty genuine. his oft-cynical observations and wry sense of humor seem to impress the unapologetically romantic celine, although she is occasionally disturbed by the extent of his alienation. when he finally admits to her that he is utterly sick of himself and likes being near her because he feels like a different person in her presence, we know he is getting somewhere. after blowing their collective funds on a series of cafes, bars, and silly diversions, they agree that because they may never see one another again, they should make the most of it. jesse bums a bottle of red wine off a sentimental bartender so that he and his newfound lady love may repair to a local park in the middle of the night to lie on the grass, looking up at the moon and the stars and watching the sun come up. given his boundless luck in the romance department, it is especially irksome when jessie, as the very definition of a naive jerk, foolishly allows this wonderful young lady to slip from his grasp. he contents himself with a half-baked plan, quickly devised at the railroad station when he bids her adieu, to reunite at the same spot in half a year. when the appointed time comes, you just know this beautiful and unusual girl will be involved with another, perhaps even married and pregnant. for whatever reason, she probably won\\'t show, while jesse, who ends up working at target or (if he\\'s lucky) the local library, will go back to vienna, desperate to see her again, only to wind up alone. despite what for me was a very discouraging conclusion, \"before sunrise\" is a beautiful movie. i highly recommend both it and the sequel, \"before sunset.\"',\n",

              " 'many of the criticisms on this thread seem to pick a comparison of this film with \"the mortal storm\" or \"casablanca\". everyone is entitled to compare films they choose, but the similarities of \"the mortal storm\" and \"watch on the rhine\" are clearly the problems of refugees threatened by the nazi juggernaut, while the main comparative point brought out with \"casablanca\" is the seeming unjust treatment of humphrey bogart in 1943 by the academy of motion picture arts and science, because they chose paul lukas instead for the best actor oscar. it does not strike me as totally wrong. lukas had a good career in film (both here and in england - he is the villain in \"the lady vanishes\"), and this performance was his best one. bogart had more great performances in him than rick blaine (for instance, he was ignored for sam spade in \"the maltese falcon\" and roy earle in \"high sierra\" two years earlier, both of which were first rate performances, and he would not get an oscar for his greatest performances as fred c. dobbs in \"the treasure of sierra madres\", the writer/murder suspect in \"in a lonely place\", and captain philip francis queeg in \"the caine mutiny\" afterward - he got it for charley in \"the african queen\"). i think that bogie should have got it for the role of dobbs, but it did not happen. but lukas was lucky - he got it on the defining performance of his lesser career. few can claim that. to me the film to look at with \"watch on the rhine\" is based on another play/script by hellman, \"the searching wind\". they both look at america\\'s spirit of isolationism in the 1920s and 1930s. \"the searching wind\" is really looking at the whole inter-war period, while \"watch on the rhine\", set in the years just proceeding our entry into world war ii, deals with a few weeks of time. therefore it is better constructed as a play, and more meaningful for it\\'s impact. the film has many good performances, led by lukas as the exhausted but determined anti-nazi fighter/courier, davis as his loyal wife (wisely keeping her character as low keyed as possible due to lukas being the center of the play\\'s activities), coulouris as the selfish, conniving, but ultimately foolish and ineffective teck, lucille watson as the mother of davis and geraldine fitzgerald (as coulouris\\' wiser and sadder and fed up wife), and kurt katch, who delivers a devastating critique (as the local embassy\\'s gestapo chief) about coulouris and others who would deal with the nazis. it has dialog with bite in it. and what it says is quite true. it also has moments of near poetry. witness the scene, towards the end, when coulouris is left alone with lukas and davis, and says, \"the new world has left the scene to the old world\". hellman could write very well at times. given the strength of the film script and performances i would rate this film highly among world war ii films.',\n",

              " 'before sunrise has many remarkable things going on, almost too many to fit into one review like this, but it\\'s suffice to say that it\\'s one of the most observant character studies of the nineties, maybe even in all of contemporary cinema, to be observant not about love, per-say, so much as it\\'s about a human connection. how does one fall in love at first sight? no one does, at least that\\'s deep down the consensus that linklater wants to show with his film. and *yet* there is the possibility of as intense a connection, of a bond that can form in those that are young and with many ideas that can be expressed articulately and with a breadth of cynicism and is somehow very tender and true at the same time. linklater here gives us the story of celine and jessie, a french girl and an american boy who get off the same train heading to vienna, and on the way there start to talking about things, at first arbitrary, then personal (jessie seeing death for the first time in his great grandfather). jessie persuades celine to go along with him on a night out on the \\'town\\', in vienna, until his plane the next morning. before sunrise gives jessie and celine, in the midst of the gorgeous vienna scenery and locales to go on and on about subjects that have a lot of importance, and in a sense is about the act of having conversations, of what it\\'s like to watch people having one leading into another and another. here it\\'s often about relationships and commitments, as jessie and celine tell stories sometimes somewhat inconsequential, or seemingly so, and another that may tell a lot about their essential qualities. we hear confessions of desires for other loves, or what weren\\'t really loves, of being part of a family or part of an upbringing that may or may not inform how you\\'ll love your life, of what it means to believe or not believe in some religious form, or just to have some connection to any faith and the soul (i loved the bit about the quakers in the church), and sometimes laced with cynicism or skepticism. jessie may be more responsible for that last part, but what\\'s fascinating about the film is that it\\'s never exactly cynical itself, just commenting upon cynicism that lays in the concerns of men and women at that age of their lives. meanwhile, it\\'s always great to see ethan hawke and julie delpy in these roles, where they\\'re not incessantly annoying in that 90s generation-x mode, but are the kinds of people where if not in the central conceit of the film, which isn\\'t a bad one at all but a necessary one, one might think to find walking along the streets of a city somewhere. the conceit is that of an old romantic picture ala brief encounter, only here intimacy is expressed in the central characters either between each other, where sweet asides are actually acceptable (\"i have to tell you a secret\", jessie says, and then leans in for a kiss, ho-ho), or in the little moments that pop up with other people along the way. i loved the scene with the poet, where it\\'s very cinematic a thing to suddenly find a random romantic bit player in the midst of a romantic picture with such beautiful words at his disposal, or with the palm reader and how the reactions from jessie and celine are that we might share, but really are seeing them do it first-hand. all the while hawke and delpy embody the roles interestingly- we can see how neuroses are being formed already for their adult lives- as it may lead off into the future... featuring splendid cinematography and a script with an ear for natural wit and a true sense of what it means to have a moment of happiness, however self-contained, as it may lead into something more. who\\'s to say you can\\'t suddenly be attached to someone, if only for less than 24 hours, and be that much more attached than a married couple? this is perhaps linklater\\'s thesis, but there\\'s more to it than just that. it\\'s a very dense film, and one that will have me calling back to it repeatedly. one scene especially, which is both cheesy and brilliant is when the two of them are talking \\'on the phone\\' in front of each other mimicking their expositions might go to the other\\'s friend. a+',\n",

              " \"before sunrise is romance for the slacker generation. richard linklater's romantic drama is an offbeat telling of a dream come true for most people. the film depicts romance in all it's glory, but without any of the pitfalls that befall most couples; and in short the film is about two people that have a relationship that's as close to perfection as relationships will ever come to - with just one problem, the problem of time. while most relationships wind down with time, this one keeps going strong throughout and time itself is the only thing that wears out. before sunrise is certainly not the typical sentimental 'hollywood romance', which is another aspect that puts this film leagues ahead of the pretenders. the story follows two people, jesse; an american and celine; a french girl that meet on a train into vienna. they instantly connect, and after telling her his awful idea for a television show and almost getting off the train, jesse asks celine to join him for the day in the picturesque city of vienna... before sunrise works principally for two reasons - realistic acting and an immense script that builds the characters through their thoughts and feelings and thus allows us to get to know them as we do the people in real life. this allows the characters to be free, and it's easy to believe that these are real people and not just actors working from a script. this also allows us to feel for the characters for who they are, and not merely because they're the protagonists. this kind of realism is hard to capture as, at the end of the day, we as the audience know that they're watching a film and not observing real life; but before sunrise represents one of the truest to life exhibitions of realism ever to be seen on screen. a truly great script cannot work on it's own, and needs great actors to deliver it to an extent that does it justice, and although i'm not a fan of either julie deply or ethan hawke; on viewing this film, there is nothing you can do but give them both respect. i don't know whether they were in character or just playing themselves, but when a film is this good; it hardly matters. in a film like this, it is the writing that's the most important thing, and contained within the script are several observations about life, most of which i personally could relate to. this represents what richard linklater has achieved with this script as not only does it create and build the characters, but it also manages to expose what true love is, along with several other aspects of life. the fact that not all the anecdotes are relatable to me personally again represents the brilliance of writing. everyone is different, and so different parts of the script will appeal to different people. there could be certain aspects about one person that one person loves and another hates; and that's the case with the musings in this script. adding to the beauty of the film is the city of vienna. the city itself isn't really important to the film as this is a story that could have taken place just about anywhere - but it makes for some lovely visuals and the upbeat, energetic romance that blossoms throughout the movie is matched by the beauty of the location. before sunrise is simultaneously beautiful and captivating. richard linklater has created something that is rare in the world of cinema; a film that captures the beauty of life without ever going over the top or being overly sentimental. before sunrise is what it is. and what it is, is pure cinematic brilliance.\",\n",

              " '\"emma\" was a product of what might be called by the first great jane austen cycle of the mid-nineties, and it was recently shown on british television, doubtless because of the interest in the author created by the second great jane austen cycle which started with \"pride and prejudice\" two years ago. we currently have in the cinemas the austen biopic \"becoming jane\", and itv have recently produced three tv movies based on austen novels. these include \"northanger abbey\", the only one of the six major novels not to have been filmed previously, so the cycle should now be complete. no doubt, however, there will be more to come in the near future. (there is, after all, her juvenile \"love and freindship\" (sic), the short novella \"lady susan\", and someone, somewhere, has doubtless supplied endings to her two unfinished fragments \"the watsons\" and \"sanditon\". then there are all those austen sequels churned out by modern writers\\x85\\x85\\x85). the main character is emma woodhouse, a young lady from an aristocratic family in regency england. (not, as some reviewers have assumed, victorian england- austen died before queen victoria was even born). emma is, financially, considerably better off than most austen heroines such as elizabeth bennett or fanny price, and has no need to find herself a wealthy husband. instead, her main preoccupation seems to be finding husbands for her friends. she persuades her friend harriet to turn down a proposal of marriage from a young farmer, robert martin, believing that harriet should be setting her sights on the ambitious clergyman mr elton. this scheme goes disastrously wrong, however, as elton has no interest in harriet, but has fallen in love with emma herself. the speed with which emma rejects his proposal makes one wonder just why she was so keen to match her friend with a man she regards (with good reason) as an unsuitable marriage partner for herself. this being a jane austen plot, emma turns out to be less of a committed spinster than she seems, and she too finds herself falling in love, leading to further complications. emma always insists that she will not marry without affection, and when she does find a partner, the handsome mr knightley, we feel that this will indeed be an affectionate marriage. it does not, however, seem likely to be a very passionate one (unlike, say, that of elizabeth bennett and mr darcy). knightley, who is sixteen years older than emma (she is 21, he 37), and related to her by marriage, is more like a father-figure than a lover. much more of a father-figure, in fact, than her actual father, a querulous and selfish old hypochondriac who seems more like her grandfather. when emma is rude to her unbearably garrulous and tedious friend miss bates, it is knightley who chides her for her lack of manners. (his surname is probably meant to indicate his gentlemanly nature- nineteenth-century gentlemen liked to think of themselves as the modern equivalent of mediaeval knights with their elaborate codes of chivalry). both gwyneth paltrow and jeremy northam play their parts very well, but this is not really one of the great screen romances. of the other characters, i liked juliet stephenson\\'s vulgar mrs elton and toni collette\\'s harriet. i know that in the novel harriet was a naïve young teenager, whereas here she is more like the character collette played in \"muriel\\'s wedding\"- a gauche, slightly overweight twentysomething, fretting about her chances of finding a man. nevertheless, i felt that this characterisation worked well in the context of the film and did not detract from austen\\'s themes. \"emma\" is one of austen\\'s more light-hearted works, without the darker overtones of \"mansfield park\" or even \"pride and prejudice\", and this is reflected on screen. we see a world of beauty and grace, full of stately homes and elegant costumes and fine manners. apart from the ruffianly gypsies, who make a very brief appearance, the only \"poor\" people we see are mrs bates and her daughter, and, as they live in the sort of picturesque rose-strewn thatched cottage which today would change hands for over £500,000, we can be sure that their poverty is relative, not absolute. in emma\\'s world, poverty is defined as not having your own stately home. this is, of course, not a comprehensive picture of early nineteenth-century life, but nobody has ever claimed austen as the regency equivalent of a kitchen-sink realist. sophisticated romantic comedy, combined with a keen eye for analysing human character, was more in her line. i would not rate this film quite as highly as the 1994 \"sense and sensibility\" or the recent \"pride and prejudice\"- it tends to drag a bit in the middle, although it has a strong beginning and strong ending- but it is, in the main, a highly enjoyable austen adaptation. 7/10',\n",

and while romance is at hand for emma, she must first recognize it, and seize the moment. \\tmcgrath has crafted and delivered a delightful, feel-good film that is like a breath of fresh air in our often turbulent world. there may be an air of frivolity about it, but in retrospect, this story deals with something that is perhaps the most important thing there is-- in all honesty-- to just about anyone: love. and with mcgrath's impeccable sense of pace and timing, it all plays out here in a way that is entirely entertaining and enjoyable. it's a pleasant, affecting film, with a wonderful cast, that successfully transports the viewer to another time and another place. it's light fare, but absorbing; and the picturesque settings and proceedings offer a sense of well-being and calm that allows you to immerse yourself in it and simply go with the flow. \\tthe winsome paltrow, who won the oscar for best actress for `shakespeare in love' two years after making this one, seems comfortable and right at home in this genre. she personifies all things british, and does it with such naturalness and facility that it's the kind of performance that is easily taken for granted or overlooked altogether. she's simply so good at what she does and makes it look so easy. she has a charismatic screen presence and an endearing manner, very reminiscent of audrey hepburn. yet paltrow is unique. as an actor, she has a wide range and style and has demonstrated-- with such films as `hard eight,' `hush' and `a perfect murder'-- that she can play just about any part effectively, and with that personal touch that makes any role she plays her own. but it's with characters like emma that she really shines. she is so expressive and open, and her personality is so engaging, that she is someone to whom it is easy to relate and just a joy to watch, regardless of the part she is playing. and for emma, she is absolutely perfect. \\tjeremy northam also acquits himself extremely well in the role of knightley, and like paltrow, seems suited to the genre-- in the right role, that is; his performance in the more recent `the golden bowl,' in which he played an italian prince, was less than satisfying. here, however, he is perfect; he is handsome, and carries himself in such a way that makes knightley believable and very real. like colin firth's mr. darcy in the miniseries `pride and prejudice,' northam has created a memorable character with his own mr. knightley. \\talso excellent in supporting roles and worthy of mention are toni collette, as emma's friend harriet smith;

              " 'director vincenzo natali first showed his penchant for character-based sci-fi flicks with his 1997 short film \"elevated\", wherein 3 people remain trapped in an elevator while unseen monsters roam the building. his follow-up feature project \"cube\", released later that year, had a very similar premise, this time with 6 people and instead of an elevator it was a vast expansion of interlocking cubic deathtraps. both were admirable attempts to take the sci-fi genre a step further, by deliberately declining to show almost any visual stimulation, choosing instead to spend as much time as possible focusing on the human element, how the characters act, react and interact under incomprehensible and dangerous conditions. after his exploration into the mainstream with 2002\\'s \"cypher\", natali has come back to his bizarre character-film trend to bring us \"nothing\", his latest, and by far most optimistic and comedic take on the wide cinematic world of \"what if?\" dave (david hewlett) and andrew (andrew miller) are life-long friends, brought together by a mutual detachment from society and a lack of any one else to be with. dave, who has always been hindered by a selfish and somewhat dimwitted nature, lives rent-free with andrew at his ill-located and ill-constructed house, where he often takes advantage of andrew\\'s neurotic and antisocial mentality. despite all this, the two misfits are happy together, until one day their deep character flaws, coupled with some astronomically bad luck, land them in the middle of some pretty serious, jail-sentence-worthy trouble. on top of this, they discover that their house has been deemed unfit for existence and is scheduled to be demolished before sunset, so in the hazy, nightmarish panic of everything going wrong for them, they wish that the whole world would just disappear. and it does. going any further with the synopsis would compromise a lot of the film\\'s slow (occasionally too slow) reveal about what\\'s happened to dave and andrew, and how they deal with their new reality. natali\\'s fascination with studying human behavior under duress (ala the birds) is here in spades, but simply by making the main characters friends rather than strangers, he\\'s able to break away from the thriller-horror element of this premise to open it up to a more comfortable and optimistic level. it\\'s almost as if he\\'s made the aphoristic opposite of \"cube\". of course, the film is not 85 minutes of laughter and sunshine. in keeping with fundamental realism, our two anti-heroes\\' dynamic often becomes antagonistic, sometimes with rather nasty results. like the \"desert island\" game, the film looks at how even best friends, when left alone together, can fall apart, but at the same time it shows that friends are vital to the quality of existence. in a very twisted, sci-fi way, this is a feel-good flick, with good heart and good intentions. however, there are a few qualms to be had with \"nothing\". while the two lead actors, hewlett and miller, do well with their parts, their characters are not nearly as interesting as they should have been, considering it is completely up to them to entertain us for the better part of an hour. there is some development in the relationship and personalities of dave and andrew, some background is given, but ultimately not enough. a generous viewer will sit through the less-engaging portions of the film to see it through to the end, but cynics will probably give up pretty fast. acting, as mentioned, is adequate, and considering the amount of \\'green-screen\\' work that would\\'ve been needed, reasonably convincing. david hewlett and andrew miller, who both wrote co-wrote the screenplay, have been long-time friends of vincenzo natali: hewlett has in fact featured in every film natali has made. perhaps it was their creative input that steered this film in a more positive direction. nonetheless, the story could have been a lot more involving. granted, it is relatively entertaining considering that (no pun intended) nothing really happens, but you get the impression that, in more experienced hands, a lot more could\\'ve been done with this premise. in all fairness, \"nothing\" is an impressive piece of work in many ways. the concept is interesting, the direction is inventive, the script works on a human level and, most of all, it shows a progression in natali\\'s creative mentality. for fans of his work, this will be a delight, and for others it will be a nice way to pass a little unwanted time. it\\'s just a shame that the director\\'s fixation on human drama prevented it from being the great, fun film it could have been.',\n",

              " 'nothing (3+ outta 5 stars) another weird premise from the director of the movie \"cube\". this time around there are two main characters who find themselves and their home transported to a mysterious white void. there is literally nothing outside of their small two-story house. intriguing to be sure, but i thought the comedic tone established for this movie from the get-go was extremely ill-conceived. there needs to be some humour, certainly... and i have no problem with the humour that was eventually derived from the plight of our two heroes (their final \"showdown\" was definitely a hoot)... but i really think the movie would have been a lot better off if it had stayed more rooted in reality in the beginning. after watching the movie i watched the \"making of\" feature on the dvd and a short trailer at the end is almost totally devoid of the \"sillier\" comedic aspects... making it look like a completely different (and slightly better) movie. the last half hour of the movie is where things really start to come together... similar in a way to the recent movie \"primer.\" the actors are fine when they are not overdoing the comedy shtick. they are really quite believable in their more \"normal\" moments. i was probably ready to write this movie off as a failed experiment at the midway point... but it won me over by the end. (and keep watching past the credits for the final scene... just don\\'t ask me to explain it.)',\n",
              " 'the premise of this movie has been tickling my imagination for quite some time now. we\\'ve all heard or read about it in some kind of con-text. what would you do if you were all alone in the world? what would you do if the entire world suddenly disappeared in front of your eyes? in fact, the last part is actually what happens to dave and andrew, two room-mates living in a run-down house in the middle of a freeway system. andrew is a nervous wreck to say the least and dave is considered being one of the biggest losers of society. that alone is the main reason to why these two guys get so well along, because they simply only have each other to turn to when comforting is needed. just until... straight from the beginning of the film lots and lots of problems happen to them. both of them get involved with crime, andrew suffers from paranoia and simply doesn\\'t dare going out of the house. dave is unsuccessful at his job and his colleagues don\\'t treat him very well and with the respect he deserves. the amount of problems they face keeps increasing until that one day where they may have to face the inevitable and deal with it. this is just too much for them and they wish that everything would just go away... and of course that is exactly what happens. the rest of the story places dave and andrew in this world of nothingness. at first they are surprised and have problems understanding and dealing with the features of this crazy environment, but later on they find out that they can do just about everything they want because it seems as if they are the only ones still left. nothing features an incredibly small cast - in fact, besides the first couple of shots from the film, we only see dave (david hewlett) and andrew (andrew miller) in the entire film. it is clear that in order to pull this off, the cast has to be more than up for the task, because in a world where nothing exists there is nothing that can distract the viewer in any way. vincenzo has decided to use a reasonable amount of close-up head shots to make it more interesting and it actually works quite well. director of photography, derek rogers, also has a nice way of teasing the audience by withholding visual information, especially at times where a character sees something and reacts to it, but we don\\'t see it right away. obviously, this can\\'t be an event driven film and it\\'s not. much of the action happens outside their house when they move around in the void. and that\\'s where some of the most hilarious scenes take place, especially in the case of when andrew discovers a candy bar. now, one could be thinking: \"how does nothing look like?\" well, it looks like nothing indeed. the entire world of nothing is white... white no matter in what direction you look. this is the weakness of this film... after an hour or less it\\'s getting extremely boring to look at and there has to be events to make sure it\\'s more interesting to look at. thank god, there are some. for example at times when the two lads, due to the properties of nothing, are able to jump really high as if nothing is made out of... tofu (as andrew claims). it\\'s fun to see how they are instantly able to use nothing to become gods of their own little society. one of the best parts of the film is the set... production designer jasna stefanovic has done a beautiful job in this film, the house in which these two guys live is so unnaturally fun to look at, still it seems right for these two to be living in a place like this. all in all, the production design is with no doubt one of the most powerful aspects of this film at it really makes the film worth watching... however, the very best part of the film is the acting. both david hewlett and andrew miller really look like the professional actors they both are. the camera is on them for every second of the film and as previously said, there are just about no props in the film, they are really on a bare stage. with plenty of character development and some decent one-liners, clever dialogue (at times hilariously stupid), it all works to that end - and this really moves the movie away from the low-budget area to well-crafted handwork. let\\'s talk a little about the visual effects, because they are definitely worth mentioning. nothing features digital visual effects and prosthetics that equals any modern horror film. there\\'s a rather horrifying dream sequence in the film, and although the drews have milked that scene completely it\\'s still fun to watch. one of the best visual effects in the film is at the end where andrew and dave suddenly discover their powers in this environment - they have the abilities to wish everything away, so what if they can do it the other way around and make things appear? \"nothing\" is a bright and well-lit movie, it really helps promoting the idea of them probably being dead (this is in fact one of their theories), but \"nothing\" is a comedy and it slowly destroys its own theory. we don\\'t know where they are or what has happened to them. we don\\'t know if they will ever get out, because the movie ends before we see anything like that. the ending, by the way, is not as good as it could\\'ve been. it\\'s rather easy to predict what is going to happen, still the writers have thought up a few incidents that help make it a little more interesting and in the end, it\\'s a reasonably satisfactory one. take \"hollow man\", \"kill bill\", \"cube\", \"epoch\" and lots of other films and you have \"nothing\". it really is an amalgam of different styles, still there is no other film (at least that i know of) nothing is really like. for the people remembering the original cube production commentary on its dvd may remember that vincenzo natali talked about how he came up with the story of cube. he talks about him and andré bijelic having been room-mates at a time and they both were in this extremely dull room with no hope of getting out, \"nothing\" could very well be the screened version of the origin of the cube story, and to that end, it\\'s almost like one of the cube prequels. what can i say? i enjoyed \"nothing\", it is a great movie and the different parts of the movie are extremely well-made with tons of intelligent ideas, still i feel the movie is missing something and i have problems finding out precisely what it is... maybe if we have a \"nothing 2\" i can answer that question. \"nothing\" is a great film, but not as good as i expected it to be. final rating: 7.5 / 10',\n",

              " '089: footlight parade (1933) - released 9/30/1933, viewed 5/5/07. the ice cream cone is invented in new york. kevin: after a long and busy break, we hit another busby berkeley musical from warner bros. this time it\\'s the ultra-fast paced footlight parade, starring james cagney as juggernaut stage producer chester kent. i am 100% certain that cagney was channeling berkeley with his performance of the irrepressible kent, who has to come up with new ideas for performances every minute. joan blondell is also excellent as the acid-tongued secretary-turned-love interest. the ruby keeler/dick powell subplot is not as major this time but no less enjoyable. one thing that baffled me was berkeley\\'s performances themselves, which seemed far too extravagant and complex to be performed on any stage, let alone a stage that would be showing a film afterwards. obviously busby doesn\\'t let a little thing like story impede him from putting together the most over-the-top musical numbers he can possibly conjure. i liked nearly all of this movie until the end, with the shamelessly offensive number \"shanghai lil,\" which, as one can guess, is about as stomach-turning as racially distasteful performances come. doug: six movies in three months. got to be a new record. anyway\\x85this completes warner bros.\\' musical trilogy of 1933, preceded by \\'42nd street\\' and \\'gold diggers of 1933.\\' i would definitely recommend watching all three in a row. i wonder if james cagney was channeling busby berkeley while he was playing chester kent in this movie, or if that the role as written was inspired by busby. i hope it was; it seems to make sense that berkeley is the kind of guy who would see elaborate dances in everyday occurrences the way chester does. the funny thing about cagney was that he didn\\'t really look like a leading man in the traditional sense. he was 5\\'7\", square-headed, and talked with an odd new york accent. but the guy was quite versatile, going from the venomous gangsters that made him so famous to the fast-talking producer-types we see here. and he could dance. basically he was a leading man in the body of a character actor. the rest of the cast has some familiar faces; joan blondell returns and just about steals the show as cagney\\'s loyal and lusting secretary; dick powell and ruby keeler play the cute couple, but seem to get less screen time than before; billy barty pops up again as the mischievous imp. the movie is typical of the more racy and adult-oriented musicals of the pre-code era, as opposed to those of the 50\\'s and 60\\'s that were more family oriented, and is an excellent climax of the warner musicals of that year (the \"shanghai lil\" number not withstanding, with keeler doing a poor job at looking chinese). last film: dinner at eight (1933). next film: i\\'m no angel (1933).',\n",

              " 'starting off, here\\'s a synopsis: porno queen alta lee (lynn lowry) is murdered by her pornographer lover max (george shannon) in a game of sexual russian roulette. alta\\'s other lover, icy lesbian casting agent camila stone (mary woronov), provides an alibi for max. but camila has an agenda of her own, and a plan involving the seduction of innocent actress julie (lynn again) in a web of sexual mind games. when the lookalikes\\' identities are sufficiently blurred, the stage is set for vengeance as passionate as the most heated carnal encounter. though this movie is quite obscure and never got much attention, i find it to be a sexy, suspenseful gem. cult goddess woronov has one of her best-ever roles, and she and sexy-innocent lowry play off each other well. the unsettling music provided by gershon kingsley, plus two original songs (\"all-american boy,\" \"you say you\\'ve never let me down\") and the jaynetts\\' \"sally, go \\'round the roses\" compose a memorable soundtrack. theodore gershuny\\'s direction is sharp, with everything photographed in muted earth tones that perfectly suggest unsavory business bubbling under society\\'s upper crust. with tons of great new york atmosphere, ondine (woronov\\'s friend and fellow warholite) giving a great performance in a small role, and exotic monique van vooren as max\\'s ex-wife in a comic sub-plot. this sub-plot, though amusing, looks like it belongs in another movie altogether. however, i\\'m not complaining, as the film is smooth even as it changes gears and is a hell of a lot more interesting that the erotic-thriller garbage currently being cranked out. trivia: sugar cookies was originally rated x (soft-core) and released by general film corporation in 1973. i am the proud owner of an original one-sheet poster--lucky me! in 1977, the movie was cut for an r and re-released by troma team, which now offers it uncut on videotape. mary woronov was the wife of theodore gershuny at the time, and was reportedly uncomfortable performing the graphic lesbian simulated sex scenes with him leering behind the camera. she can also be seen in two of his earlier productions, kemek (1970) and silent night, bloody night (1972).',\n",

              " \"there is no denying that ealing comedies are good, but for me this film stands out as one of the best. the basic premise of the film is that a small part of pimlico in london is discovered to be part of burgundy, not the uk. we then follow the lives of the residents in their battle to keep the treasure found after the bomb explodes, and keep out the black market traders who soon realise that being exempt from uk law, rationing does not exist. when they become prisoners in their own street because the government has decided to close the boarder we see them fight back against the system. they are forced to ration water and food in their stand for what is right. in fact becoming worse off than they were before it all started, that's where the moral comes in. it's when they loose all the food that they think they are beaten and call for a surrender, only to have the whole of london respond to their plight by sending food, lot's of it. thus enabling them to continue their struggle. this film hit's the right note throughout, the acting is superb, with stanley holloway, margaret rutherford, hermione baddeley and betty warren standing out. it's pitched just right, not too sentimental and the moral of the story not forced down your throat. well worth a viewing\",\n",

              " 'passport to pimlico is a real treat for all fans of british cinema. not only is it an enjoyable and thoroughly entertaining comedy, but it is a cinematic flashback to a bygone age, with attitudes and scenarios sadly now only a memory in british life. stanley holloway plays pimlico resident arthur pemberton, who after the accidental detonation of an unexploded bomb, discovers a wealth of medieval treasure belonging to the 14th century duke of burgundy that has been buried deep underneath their little suburban street these last 600 years. accompanying the treasure is an ancient legal decree signed by king edward iv of england (which has never been officially rescinded) to state that that particular london street had been declared burgandian soil, which means that in the eyes of international law, pemberton and the other local residents are no longer british subjects but natives of burgundy and their tiny street an independent country in it\\'s own right and a law unto itself. this sets the war-battered and impoverished residents up in good stead as they believe themselves to be outside of english law and jurisdiction, so in an act of drunken defiance they burn their ration books, destroy and ignore their clothing coupons, flagrantly disregard british licencing laws etc, declaring themselves fully independent from britain. however, what then happens is ever spiv, black marketeer and dishonest crook follows suit and crosses the \\'border\\' into burgundy as a refuge from the law and post-war restrictions to sell their dodgy goods, and half of london\\'s consumers follow them in order to dodge the ration, making their quiet happy little haven, a den of thieves and a rather crowded one at that. appealing to whitehall for assistance, they are told that due to developments this is \"now a matter of foreign policy, which his majesty\\'s government is reluctant to become involved\" which leaves the residents high and dry. they do however declare the area a legal frontier and as such set up a fully equipped customs office at the end of the road, mainly to monitor smuggling than to ensure any safety for the residents of pimlico. eventually the border is closed altogether starting a major siege, with the bugundian residents slowly running out of water and food, but never the less fighting on in true british style. as one bugundian resident quotes, \"we\\'re english and we always were english, and it\\'s just because we are english, we are fighting so hard to be bugundians\" a sentiment that is soon echoed throughout the capital as when the rest of london learn of the poor bugundians plight they all feel compelled to chip in and help them, by throwing food and supplies over the barbed wire blockades. will whitehall, who has fought off so may invaders throughout the centuries finally be brought to it\\'s knees by this new batch of foreigners, especially as these ones are english!!!! great tale, and great fun throughout. not to be missed.',\n",
              " 'my former cambridge contemporary simon heffer, today a writer and journalist, has put forward the theory that, just as british film-makers in the eighties were often critical of what they called \"thatcher\\'s britain\", the ealing comedies were intended as satires on \"attlee\\'s britain\", the britain which had come into being after the labour victory in the 1945 general election. this theory was presumably not intended to apply to, say, \"kind hearts and coronets\" (which is, if anything, a satire on the edwardian upper classes) or to \"the ladykillers\" or \"the lavender hill mob\", both of which may contain some satire but are not political in nature. it can, however, be applied to most of the other films in the series, especially \"passport to pimlico\". pimlico is, or at least was in the forties, a predominantly working-class district of london, set on the north bank of the thames about a mile from victoria station. it is not quite correct to say, as has often been said, that the film is about pimlico \"declaring itself independent\" of britain. what happens is that an ancient charter comes to light proving that in the fifteenth century the area was ceded by king edward iv to the duchy of burgundy. this means that, technically, pimlico is an independent state, and has been for nearly five hundred years, irrespective of the wishes of its inhabitants. the government promise to pass a special act of parliament to rectify the anomaly, but until the act receives the royal assent the area remains outside the united kingdom and british laws do not apply. because pimlico is not subject to british law, the landlord of the local pub is free to open whatever hours he chooses and local shopkeepers can sell whatever they please to whomever they please, unhindered by the rationing laws. when other traders start moving into the area to sell their goods in the streets, the british authorities are horrified by what they regard as legalised black-marketeering and seal off the area to try and force the \"burgundians\", as the people of pimlico have renamed themselves, to surrender. many of the ealing comedies have as their central theme the idea of the little man taking on the system, either as an individual as happens in \"the man in the white suit\" or \"the lavender hill mob\", or as part of a larger community as happens in \"whisky galore\" or \"the titfield thunderbolt\". the central theme of \"passport\" is that of ordinary men and women taking on bureaucracy and government-imposed regulations which seemed to be an increasingly important feature of life in the britain of the forties. the film\\'s particular target is the rationing system. during the war the system had been accepted by most people as a necessary sacrifice in the fight against nazism, but it became increasingly politically controversial when the government tried to retain it in peacetime. it was a major factor in the growing unpopularity of the attlee administration which had been elected with a large majority in 1945, and organisations such as the british housewives\\' league were set up to campaign for the abolition of rationing. i cannot agree with the reviewer who stated that the main targets of the film\\'s satire were the \"spivs\" (black marketeers), who play a relatively minor part in the action, or the housewives\\' league, who do not appear at all. the satire is very much targeted at the bureaucrats, who are portrayed either as having a \"rules for rules\\' sake\" mentality or a desire to pass the buck and avoid having to take any action at all. i suspect that if the film were to be made today it would have a different ending with pimlico remaining independent as a british version of monaco or san marino. (indeed, i suspect that today this concept would probably serve as the basis of a tv sitcom rather than a film). in 1949, however, four years after the end of the war, the film-makers were keen stress patriotism and british identity, so the film ends with pimlico being reabsorbed into britain. one of the best-known lines from the film is \"we always were english and we always will be english and it\\'s just because we are english that we\\'re sticking up for our right to be burgundians\". there is a sharp contrast between the rather heartless attitude of officialdom with the common sense, tolerance and good humour of the cockneys of pimlico, all of which are presented as being quintessentially british characteristics. most of the action takes place during a summer drought and sweltering heatwave, but in the last scene, after pimlico has rejoined the uk the temperature drops and it starts to pour with rain. global warming may have altered things slightly, but for many years part of being british was the ability to hold the belief, whatever statistics might say to the contrary, that britain had an abnormally wet climate. the ability to make jokes about that climate was equally important. there is a good performance from stanley holloway as arthur pemberton, the grocer and small-time local politician who becomes the prime minister of free pimlico, and an amusing cameo from margaret rutherford as a batty history professor. in the main, however, this is, appropriately enough for a film about a small community pulling together, an example of ensemble acting with no real star performances but with everyone making a contribution to an excellent film. it lacks the ill-will and rancour of many more recent satirical films, but its wit and satire are no less effective for all that. it remains one of the funniest satires on bureaucracy ever made and, with the possible exception of \"kind hearts and coronets\" is my personal favourite among the ealing comedies. 10/10',\n",
              " \"every time this film is on the bbc somebody in the radio times says how it is a satire against the post war world of rationing and the welfare state. i do not think this is the point of the film at all. the film parodies the spivs(small time criminals who ran the blackmarket) and the housewives league who campaigned against government restrictions but were really a tory front organisation. yes of course the film sends up the political/social situation but in the end the people realise that they need all the controls to ensure a fair society,they want to be british and muddle through rather than foreign. but i don't think they go back to being exactly like they were before.\",\n",

              " \"there has been a political documentary, of recent vintage, called why we fight, which tries to examine the infamous military industrial complex and its grip on this nation. it is considered both polemical and incisive in making its case against both that complex and the war fiasco we are currently involved in in iraq. yet, a far more famous series of films, with the same name, was made during world war two, by hollywood director frank capra. although considered documentaries, and having won oscars in that category, this series of seven films is really and truly mere agitprop, more in the vein of leni reifenstal's triumph of the will, scenes of which capra recycles for his own purposes. that said, that fact does not mean it does not have vital information that subsequent generations of world war two documentaries (such as the bbc's lauded the world at war) lacked, nor does that mean that its value as a primary source is any the less valuable. they are skillfully made, and after recently purchasing some used dvds at a discount store, i found myself with the opportunity to select a free dvd with my purchase. i chose goodtimes dvd's four dvd collection of the series. rarely has something free been so worth invaluable. while there are no extras on the dvds, and the sound quality of the prints varies, these films provide insight into the minds of americans two thirds of a century ago, when racism was overt (as in many of the classic warner brothers pro-war cartoons of the era), and there was nothing wrong with blatant distortion of facts. the seven films, produced between 1942 and 1945, are prelude to war, the nazis strike, divide and conquer, the battle of britain, the battle of russia, the battle of china, and war comes to america. overall, the film series is well worth watching, not only for the obvious reasons, but for the subtle things it reveals, such as the use of the plural for terms like x millions when referring to dollars, rather than the modern singular, or the most overused graphic in the whole series- a japanese sword piercing the center of manchuria. yet, it also shows the complexities of trying to apply past standards to current wars. the lesson of world war one (avoid foreign entanglements) was not applicable to world war two, whose own lesson (act early against dictatorships) has not been applicable in the three major wars america has fought since: korea, vietnam, nor iraq. the fact that much of this series teeters on the uncertainties of the times it was made in only underscores its historic value in today's information-clogged times. it may not help you sort out the truth from the lies and propaganda of today, but at least you'll realize you are not the first to be in such a tenuous position, nor will you be the last.\",\n",

              " 'when i really began to be interested in movies, at the age of eleven, i had a big list of \\'must see\\' films and i would go to blockbuster and rent two or three per weekend; some of them were not for all audiences and my mother would go nuts. i remember one of the films on that list was \"a chorus line\" and could never get it; so now to see it is a dream come true. of course, i lost the list and i would do anything to get it back because i think there were some really interesting things to watch there. i mean, take \"a chorus line\", a stage play turned into film. i know it\\'s something we see a lot nowadays, but back then it was a little different, apparently; and this film has something special. most of the musicals made movies today, take the chance the camera gives them for free, to create different sceneries and take the characters to different places; \"a chorus line\" was born on a theater stage as a play and it dies in the same place as a movie. following a big audition held by recognized choreographer zach (michael douglas), richard atenborough directs a big number of dancers as they try to get the job. everything happens on the same day: the tension of not knowing, the stress of having to learn the numbers, the silent competition between the dancers\\x85and it all occurs on the stage, where douglas puts each dancer on the spotlight and makes them talk about their personal life and their most horrible experiences. there are hundreds of dancers and they are all fantastic, but they list shortens as the hours go by. like a movie i saw recently, \"a prairie home companion\", the broadcast of a radio show, atenborough here deals with the problem of continuity. on or behind the stage, things are going on, and time doesn\\'t seem to stop. again, i don\\'t if atenborough cut a lot to shoot this, but it sure doesn\\'t look like it; and anyway it\\'s a great directing and editing (john bloom) work. but in that little stage, what you wonder is what to do with the camera\\x85with only one setting, ronnie taylor\\'s cinematography finds the way, making close-ups to certain characters, zooming in and out, showing the stage from different perspective and also giving us a beautiful view of new york. in one crucial moment, douglas tells the ones that are left: \"before we start eliminating: you\\'re all terrific and i\\'d like to hire you all; but i can\\'t\". this made me think about reality shows today, where the only thing that counts is the singing or dancing talent and where the jury always says that exact words to the contestants before some of them are leaving (even when they are not good). it\\'s hard, you must imagine; at least here, where all of them really are terrific. to tell some of the stories, the characters use songs and, in one second, the stage takes a new life and it literally is \\'a dream come true\\'. the music by marvin hamlisch and the lyrics by edward kleban make the theater to film transition without flaws, showing these dancers\\' feelings and letting them do those wonderful choreographies by michael bennett. the book in the theater also becomes a flawless and very short screenplay by arnold schulman; which is very touching at times. so if it\\'s not with a song it will be with a word; but in \"a chorus line\", it\\'s impossible not to be moved. during one of the rehearsal breaks in the audition, cassie, a special dancer played by alyson reed, takes the stage to convince douglas character that she can do it. the words \"let me dance for you\" never sounded more honest and more beautifully put in music and lyrics.',\n",

(he had a very different role in another stanley baker film \"hell drivers\"). his portrayal of johnny and the fanatical following he inspired was very frightening. ann heywood was also very good as the cynical cathie. i wouldn\\'t say there was a romantic subplot in it. detective jack truman is investigating a string of arson attacks by someone labeled the \"firefly\". just as he finds evidence which could lead to a breakthrough, he is assigned to the juvenile division - he is pretty disgusted at what he feels is not proper police work. amid all the heckling he gets his first call out - the 6 year old murphy twins are working a scam at the local lolly shops!!! taking the twins home he meets their brother, the charismatic johnny, and their embittered sister cathie. he starts to appreciate how life on the ghastly housing estates can turn young kids into criminals. as he gets more involved with the family, he realises there is a strong link between the fires, johnny and a frightened chinese youth who works for a laundry. the local priest (peter cushing in an unusual role, away from the hammer horrors) explains that when johnny was younger he had rescued some people from a burning building and had been hailed a hero. he wanted to recapture the feeling of importance and being useful and felt he could by lighting fires. the school siege was filmed in a very real way and the viewer felt the children\\'s fear - the teacher (thinking only of her own safety) runs off and locks them in the room with the frightened gunman!!!! i thought it was a really excellent film that tried to show some of the social problems britain experienced after the war. highly recommended.',\n",

              " 'some years ago, satellite channel u.k. gold promoted repeats of \\'men behaving badly\\' with the hype: \"here it is, the original flat-sharing sitcom!\". this was in fact untrue. \\'man about the house\\' was also a flat-sharing sitcom and ran from 1973-76. it was the brainchild of johnnie mortimer and brian cooke, creators of the popular sitcom \\'father dear father\\'. when it ended, they decided they wanted to do something more in harmony with the times. in the first episode, chrissy ( paula wilcox ) and jo ( sally thomsett ) are tidying their myddleton terrace flat following a wild party when they find a man in their bath. he is robin tripp ( richard o\\'sullivan ), a southampton cookery student of no fixed abode. while his clothes dry out, he puts on a ladies\\' dressing gown and prepares them a meal. they are so impressed by his culinary skills that they invite him to stay. but there must be no naughty business. so robin has to pretend to be gay... on b.b.c.-2\\'s \\'i love 1973\\', shown in 2000, julie burchill claimed that \\'house\\' showed her a way of life she envied. she was not alone. one of the most iconic ( for me, anyway ) images of \\'70\\'s british television was sally thomsett coming out of the london underground carrying a parasol, and a \\'blind\\' man doing a double take as her pert bottom swings past. a man living with two girls was a risqué subject for the time, but mrs.mary whitehouse had no need to get hot under the collar, it was innocent, good-natured fun. mortimer and cooke\\'s scripts went as close as they could to the edge without crossing it. richard o\\'sullivan was still playing \\'bingham\\' in i.t.v.\\'s \\'doctor in charge\\' when this got started. in fact the second run of \\'in charge\\' overlapped with the first of \\'house\\'. he was born to play the sex-mad robin. paula wilcox\\'s \\'chrissy\\' was more streetwise than \\'beryl\\', her character she played in \\'the lovers\\', while sally thomsett\\'s \\'jo\\' was a lovable dizzy blonde. as time wore on, he became almost like an older brother to them. for many viewers, brian murphy and yootha joyce stole the show as the warring ropers. george had lost interest in sex, but mildred had not. they went on to their own show - the aptly titled \\'george & mildred\\'. the late doug fisher was good value as as robin\\'s wideboy friend larry. he worked so well he was made into a regular. within a year of its debut, there was the inevitable movie spin-off. i am not a big fan of the \\'man about the house\\' movie because i think it was stretched to fit the big screen. most of its characters had never appeared in the series. the format was sold to america, where it became the long-running \\'three\\'s company\\' starring the late john ritter and suzanne somers. it was far more suggestive than the british original, with somers often seen in sexy clothing. after six seasons, \\'house\\' ended with chrissy marrying robin\\'s older brother norman ( norman eshley ). fans were devastated to see robin failing to get the girl he loved, but there was some consolation in the fact that he too landed his own show - \\'robin\\'s nest\\'.',\n",

              " \"incredible documentary captured all the frenzied chaos and misery which loomed over nyc on that fateful morning of september 11th. intense, personal, and completely riveting, 9/11 is perhaps the greatest documentary ever made by accident, which kind of gives it an even greater appeal. up until that morning, filmmakers gideon and jules naudet had been following around a new york firefighter team, concentrating specifically on one new recruit in a little piece they were shooting dealing with the rigorous training to become a fireman. out with the team that morning filming yet another simple routine cleanup, jules lifts his camera up to the sky just in time to record one of the only known images of the first plane hitting the world trade center, and from there a simple documentary was no more. viewers are given a first hand account of what it was like to be in and around ground zero, as the amazing group of fire-fighters and one profoundly bewildered cameraman attempt to navigate this disaster. without hesitation, naudet follows these automatically programmed heroes into the tower while it's entire support crumbles around them. the raw fear of an unknown, impending doom lurks with more viability then any fictional production could ever fathom as we watch less and less become audible and visible for those trapped inside. nearly as memorable is older brother gideon's candid capturing of an entire city in the throngs of a larger and more palpable fear then anything they had collectively witnessed. by the time we get to see the second tower collapse, as the cameraman shields himself from apocalyptic debris, we should all but be rinsing the dirt off ourselves from the amazingly up-close footage captured. obviously the filmmakers deserve only as much credit as being in the right place at the right time to document such an extraordinary event, though one can only admire the two brothers in their extraordinary adaptation to such an event; in a few desperate minutes we witness them become like the firemen they document- only instead of saving lives they knew they had to save footage, even if it cost them their own safety. after viewing 9/11, and seeing that it came out in 2002, i feel much more resentment towards oliver stone's recent rendition, the big budgeted world trade center. many had criticized the film for ignorantly narrowing down the focus to those two survivors trapped in rubble, and although i enjoyed the movie just fine for the small and sentimental hollywood focus it brought, 9/11 all but renders his film completely obsolete. not only will this utterly gripping footage remain the only definitive collection from that day, but the sublime transfer of motives midway ensures that this documentary has all the heart and character needed to never sensationalize the event again.\",\n",
              " 'to sum this documentary up in a few words is next to impossible. every fiber of your body tells you that this is not happening right from the opening montage of rapid-fire images, through to the last shot of the clean up at ground zero, but every frame is real. the story was thought up by two french brothers living in new york. jules (28) and gideon (31) naudet (pronounced \"nau-day\") want to make a documentary on new york city firefighters, beginning with a \"newbie\" from the academy and follow him through the nine month probationary period to full-fledged firefighter. seeking the help of their close friend, actor james hanlon (36), an actor and firefighter at station 1, engine 7, the naudets sift through the \"probies\" at the academy and find one, tony benetakos to focus the bulk of their documentary on. tony becomes the butt of jokes and slowly learns the ins and outs of station life through the members of this close-knit family. firefighters have a superstition about \"probies.\" it is that they are either \"white clouds\" or \"black clouds,\" meaning that with the latter, all kinds of fires follow the \"probie.\" the former means that very little fire activity follows, but one day, there will be the mother of all fires. tony is a \"white cloud.\" after some initial growing pains, tony settles into the firehouse as if he were a seasoned vet. then the unthinkable occurs.... september 11, 2001 begins with a clear blue sky and an early morning call to go and see about a supposed gas leak not far from wall street. because jules has had little camera experience, gideon hands a camera to his younger brother and tells him to ride with the chief, t. k. pfeiffer. arriving at about 8:42, the firefighters begin to use their gas detectors over a grate. then the sudden roar of what seems to be a low flying airplane rips past the scene, and as jules pans upwards, we see the first strike of the day. american airlines flight 11 smashes into the face of the north tower of 1 world trade. pfeiffer orders his men into the fire engine and they head for the world trade center. once there, jules asks to accompany the chief into the tower. pfeiffer tells naudet to stick close to him. once inside, the full impact of the growing disaster begins to show on the faces of the men whose sole purpose is to save lives. gideon naudet decides to leave the firehouse and walk down to the impact area. once there, he captures the impact of the second plane, united airlines flight 175, with 2 world trade. he knows jules is with chief pfeiffer inside the towers. watching and capturing the crowds\\' reaction to the unimaginable, gideon begins to capture on tape the growing fear in lower manhattan. inside tower one, jules records the last view the world, or loved ones will have of their sons, fathers, uncles, grandfathers, husbands, boyfriends, friends as one by one, each firefighter, carrying 60 lbs of equipment begin the long arduous climb up 80 stories to rescue the injured and trapped. jules also catches the last glimpse chief pfeiffer will have of his brother, kevin, as he leaves to do his selfless duty. also caught on video is the gutwrenching sound of falling bodies hitting pavement from victims choosing to jump from the higher floors above the impact zones, sooner than face death at the hands of the flames and smoke. but jules is respectful, never once does he capture a sensationalistic moment...the money shot. his work is professional through his baptism of fire. he also catches the sight of debris falling from tower two after it is hit by the second plane and the ordered way the firefighters evacuated civilians from the building. then jules is caught in the collapse of the south tower and the first official victim is taken: father michael judd, the chaplain for the fire department. then as jules and chief pfeiffer make their way from the fallout of the collapse of tower two, tower one begins its structural collapse. what results is a breathtakingly, poignant view from inside ground zero as jules and gideon work separately to document that day. not knowing if either is alive, each fearing the worst. as each firefighter arrives at the firehouse, they greet each other with joyous hugs at having made it back. and in one moment of overwhelming emotion, jules and gideon are reunited. as jules cries on his brother\\'s shoulder, gideon embraces his younger brother as hanlon makes the filmmakers the subject. there is one fearful moment when tony benetakos, who left the station with a former chief, is believed to have been lost...but returns to the fold, this \"probie\" has proven himself. shown with only three interruptions, 9/11 is a stunning achievement in documentary filmmaking. it ranks up there with the hindenburg footage in showing history as it unfolds. the naudets are to be commended for their deft handling of the subject. in lesser hands, the tendency would be toward the sensational, but the naudets temper their eye toward dignity and compassion. narrated by hanlon, we get the feel of his words as he takes the audience through the events of september 11. robert de niro hosts the program in a sombre, restrained way. he never seeks the camera for his own glory, rather he lays out the scenes you are about to see. i also commend cbs for their bravery at airing this special. chastised for their attempt at grabbing ratings, they temper their editing toward the emotions of the relatives of those who perished. this is a must see for anyone who needs to be reminded of what true heroism is. it isn\\'t about dribbling a basketball, or selling an album of hate lyrics...9/11 is about humanity at its best. heroism at its finest and the cost of freedom.

              " \"9/11 is a classic example of cinema verite, a sort of realist documentary, in this case of new york firemen as they battle against one of the most extraordinary events of world history. it's all tiny, unobtrusive, hand-held video cameras, often betrayed by the poor quality of most of the filming (and by the director, naudet's hand frequently wiping the screen). in this film, you get to know most of the firemen - tony benatatos, the rookie (or 'probie', in ny fireman vernacular), the fire chief joseph pfeiffer (who finds he's lost his brother later on) and a few others. there are studio interviews with most of these people throughout the film, just to emphasise the personal, reflexive nature of the events. the build-up is quite dramatic and well-done, particularly the passing-out ceremony at the fire department, with a few useful swish-pans and a sort of dialectical editing of the rather limited filmwork (just like rob reiner's a few good men). tony looks proud. the viewpoint and camera angle is usually from amidst the firemen, which is interesting and there is some excellent footage from inside the lobby of wtc1 while pfeiffer and his team plan what to do next - this is classic cinema verite. there is also the eery, haunting sound of the occasional human body crashing against the portico outside. it is then that an increasingly forlorn fire chief pfeiffer realises that his task is desperate and probably hopeless - and this is before wtc2 collapses. you have to give credit to naudet for knowing which faces to film and at which moment. the sound of the neighbouring wtc2 collapsing is so awfully sad, poignant and terrifying that you realise what an ordeal this is for the firemen. from the lobby, it looks, feels and sounds like the end of the world and the poor firemen look so utterly bewildered and frightened. you hear an enormous rumbling, trembling maelstrom - like that of a giant, monolithic beast slowly falling to the ground after being so mortally wounded - the neighbouring tower has collapsed yet the fire team remaining in wtc1 are oblivious to this event. where is the communication? this film is captivating yet the narration is amateurish and should have been avoided - cues like 'this really was a day like no other' or naudet's frequently banal pronouncements like 'you could see fear in everybody's eyes' and 'i knew tony was freaking out'! the film is really just one long video diary. there are no pictures from higher up the building where some of the firemen have gone. imagine this film blended with cctv footage from some of the rooms higher up or some of the news coverage from the day. the effect would be greater. you could even combine this story with that of mayor giuliani and, perhaps, the famous cornishman rick riscorla who literally was many floors up acting the hero. i don't see much of a propaganda element in this film, as some reviewers suggest. this film is no triumph of the will, by riefenstahl. some time later the firemen drape the american flag over a nearby, surviving building overlooking what has become ground zero. so what? there are also some moments of dubious camerawork; for example, who is holding the camera when the two naudet brothers are reunited back at the fire station? is it staged? there is an excellent finish, very much in the traditon of the excellent french director alain resnais (hiroshima mon amour), with two strips of light reflected in the water, shimmying.\",\n",
              " 'it\\'s true that you always remember what you were doing at a point when disaster or tragedy strikes. and none more so that september 11, 2001, a date which changed the entire global landscape in its fight against terrorism. no, this documentary didn\\'t set out to be dwelling on the events leading to 9/11. rather, the filmmakers, brothers gédéon and jules naudet, set out to do a documentary on the trials and tribulations of a rookie new york firefighter. they had gone to the academy and done some shoots of training, and had handpicked their \"proby\" (probation firefighter) to join them in an ny firehouse, home to ladder 1 and engine 7. but their production was to develop and contain at that time, believed to be the only shot of the first plane slamming into the world trace center. i was traveling back with a friend on the train from a night of lan gaming, and received a call at about 850pm local time from my dad, who informed me of the above. few minutes later, he told me there was another, and that the wtc was under attack. by the time i arrived home, the upper floors of the twin towers were ablaze and in smoke, and to my horror, they collapsed, under an hour. the filmmakers had two cameras running that day, one who had followed a team out on a routine call, and which immediately raced to the wtc upon hearing and seeing the plane crash into it. we follow what is possible the only filmed sequence of events in the lobby of wtc1 where the first responders of firefighters, paramedics, and police had to make sense of what happened, and to quickly develop a plan of action. the other camera, held by the other brother, was making his way to wtc to look for his sibling, and along the journey, captured the many expressions of new yorkers, as well as the sense of chaos in and around manhatten. peppered throughout the documentary are numerous interviews with the men from ladder 1 and engine 7, which miraculously, did not suffer any casualty. but being survivors also brought about its own set of psychological turmoil, as they struggle to come to terms with the event. through the events that unfold, we learn of the strong camaraderie amongst these men who risk live and limb each day on their jobs, to save lives. we began with what the documentary was supposed to be, before events of the day totally swung in and became the focus, right up to the rescue phase where hopes of finding survivors under the rubble were kept alive by the men who work round the clock in making sense of the collapsed steel structures. it\\'s not a film that is fabricated, and what you see here cannot be recreated in any other documentary (and heavens, not sound stages for hollywood blockbusters). it\\'s as close as you can get to that day, witnessing the event up close, from safety. code 1 dvd contains a separate extra hour of 4 sets of interviews with the men of ladder 1 and engine 7.',\n",
              " 'super-slick entertainment with a stellar cast, an outstanding script, and a firm grip on the approaching 1950\\'s. at the time, rko was turning out classic noirs by the dozens. but whatever the value of those shadowy downers, they reflected a war-time mood soon to give way the sunnier climes of the eisenhower era. few films of the late-40\\'s are further from that noir cycle or more attuned to the coming consumer decade than this sassy little comedy. jim blandings (cary grant) works as an ad-man on madison ave. where in his little daughter\\'s words-- he sells things to people that they don\\'t need, at prices they can\\'t afford. he\\'s making good money, but like thousands of others, he\\'s tired of living in a cramped urban \"cave\". so, with wife myrnah loy, they strike out after their dream house in the wilds of the connecticutt countryside. needless to say, in the arms of nature, they get more than they bargained for and in hilarious fashion. there\\'s hardly a lifeless line in the entire script. i don\\'t know if writers panama and frank got an oscar, but they should have. of course, the humor revolves around all the problems that pop-up when city people build a big house on rural land. the annoyances pile up almost as fast as the mortgage, with all the eccentric types running the construction show and giving grant a hard time. of course, no one carries off annoyance or frustration more humorously than grant, so it\\'s just one well-placed laugh after another, particularly when the locked closet appears to have an infernal mind of its own. yet, oddly, the film appears to have no comedic high-point. instead the laughs are spaced out so expertly that they don\\'t peak at any particular point. that\\'s a real movie triumph for any era. reaching back 60 years later, we can see how deftly the script ideas look ahead rather than behind. with their live-in maid, the blandings may not be a typical american family, but that post-war migration from cramped cities to spacious suburbia was typical. and what more suggestive job for the coming consumerism than blandings as an \"ad-man\" tasked with finding catchier ways to sell more \"ham\". more than anything, however, there\\'s the movie\\'s sunny optimism. oh sure, the feeling falters at times, yet the belief that a better future is on the horizon if the blandings just stick to their dream carries them through. indeed, life was going to improve for a lot of people during the coming surge, so i expect the film resonated deeply with audiences of the day. it\\'s that easily over-looked subtext, along with the sheer entertainment value, that makes this movie a key comedy statement of the post-war period. so, if you haven\\'t seen it, catch it next time around.',\n",

              " \"i was one of many that expected to see a glorified, yankee-doodle dandy portrayal of a day that (as famously quoted) should live in infamy, rather than glory. how wrong i was. these guys were there, right in the middle of it, and the pictures they returned are both amazing and heartbreaking. and yet it all occurred on a chance trip to the world trade centre on september 11, 2001. two french filmmakers were compiling a documentary about life as a ny firefighter, particularly from the perspective of a young rookie coming up through the ranks. at the beginning we see much of this footage, just to remind us that there was no thought to producing a film about terrorism. this was intended to be a film about regular people earning an honest living helping others, and the beauty of the film is that it never loses this edge. while investigating a suspect gas line (i think, my memory's a little hazy on that), we suddenly hear a plane fly overhead. the camera pans up to reveal a commercial jet torpedoing itself into one of the towers. what must the cameraman have been thinking at this time? recognising the importance of the footage the camera stays on, and possibly realizing the same thing, the fdny allow the camera to follow them into the building. what follows is a true view from the front-lines. we see the commitment of the fdny, their reactions (the stunned silence after hearing the first person fall to their death is chilling) as well as the collapse of the one of the buildings from the inside, while a second camera captures the events from the outside. if it wasn't for the horrific event they were covering, the footage alone would be any young doco-maker's dream come true. quite simply, the footage deserves to be preserved for all time. but what really sets this film apart is the genuine humanity that it brings to the viewer. we see firefighters charging in without hesitation, people of different races helping one another escape to wave of rubble and even the concern of the filmmakers for one another (they are brothers) as they cannot reach one another in the confusion. there are amazing sights as well as amazing human stories in this film, something hollywood could never duplicate (even though it's trying). 9/11 isn't a film about politics. nor is it a film about religion, nationality or even jihad for that matter. 9/11 is a film about people, and a true indication of the best and worst that we are capable of. 9/11 is quite simply one of the most important films i've ever seen, and would be the only film to be born from this event if it were up to me. you can't duplicate this.\",\n",

              " 'coinciding with the start of the baby boom, the years after world war ii saw an unprecedented exodus of americans moving out of their city apartments into the suburbs where they can fulfill their dreams of owning their own homes. directed by h.c. potter and co-written by norman panama and melvin frank (\"white christmas\"), this lightweight but surprisingly observant 1948 screwball comedy captures the feeling of that period very well. of course, it helps to have a trio of expert farceurs \\x96 cary grant, myrna loy and an especially acerbic melvyn douglas \\x96 head the proceedings with their natural likability at odds with the escalating frustrations of home ownership. even though the film is sixty years old now, there is a timeless quality to the blandings\\' dream and the barriers they face in achieving it. obviously, hollywood thinks so since it\\'s been remade at least twice - first as a very physical tom hanks comedy, 1986\\'s \"the money pit\", and again last year with ice cube\\'s \"are we done yet?\". one look at hgtv\\'s programming schedule will show you how the situations explored here still resonate today. the plot begins with ad man jim blandings, his wife muriel and their two daughters cramped into a two bedroom-one bath manhattan apartment. rather than pursue muriel\\'s idea to renovate the apartment for $7,000, jim sees a photo of a connecticut house in a magazine and realizes this is where they need to move. with the help of an opportunistic real estate agent and against the advice of their attorney and family friend bill cole, the blandings decide to buy a ramshackle house badly in need of repair. however, the foundation sags so badly that the house needs to be torn down in favor of a new one. this sparks the blandings to push the architect to design a house so excessive that the second floor is twice as big as the first. costs rise with each new complication, tempers flare, and even a romantic triangle is imagined among, jim, muriel and bill. priorities finally sort themselves out but not before some funny slapstick scenes and clever dialogue that tweaks the not-so-blissful ignorance of the new homeowners. with his double takes and flawless line delivery, grant is infallible in this type of farce, and jim blandings epitomizes his more domesticated mid-career characters. in a role originally meant for irene dunne, myrna loy shows why she was hollywood\\'s perfect wife. she doesn\\'t get many of the funnier lines, but she combines her special blend of flightiness and sauciness to make muriel an appealing character on her own. watch her deftly maneuver the overly agreeable house painter with her absurdly idiosyncratic color palette. as avuncular, pipe-smoking bill (\"cole\\x85bill cole\"), melvyn douglas shows his natural, easy-going élan as grant\\'s foil. smaller roles are filled expertly with particularly memorable turns by harry shannon as the laconic well-digger mr. tesander, lurene tuttle as jim\\'s officious assistant mary, and louise beavers as the blandings\\' lovable maid gussie. the 2004 dvd provides some intriguing vintage material including two radio versions of the movie - the first a 1949 version that did end up pairing grant and dunne and then a second 1950 version coupling grant with his then-wife, actress betsy drake. a most appropriate 1949 cartoon, \"the house of tomorrow\", is also included giving us a comical tour of a futuristic dream house. the original theatrical trailers for ten of grant\\'s film classics complete the extras.',\n",

              " 'japanese tomo akiyama\\'s keko mask (1993) is extremely enjoyable trash film and so fun to watch! there are also some sequels, but i haven\\'t seen them since these films are hyper rare. some kind of re-releases some day would be nice since i think many trash lovers would like these films. the tongue in cheek story is about one extremely strict school in which teachers think that it is okay to torture students in order to attain discipline, which is, according to the teachers, the most important thing in education. the school is lead by incredibly funny looking (just look at the costume!) human wizard/whatever, who is like principal in the school, and it only adds to the campiness that it is never explained why he wears such a costume since all other teachers are perfectly normally clothed. well, the main thing about the film is its name, keko mask, who is some beautiful and masked fairy, who comes always to save the girls and students who are abused and tortured by the teachers! yes, this superheroine is one effective female as she kicks and fights the evil teachers with totally cheesy soundtrack playing on the background. the most important thing is, of course, that she wears nothing but a cape and a mask with the rest of her body naked! her identity is never revealed in these films, and also the credits say \"keko mask: unknown\" while the actor names are listed! the most hilarious thing in this film is how keko mask kills her enemies. she has a gorgeous, but lethal vagina! yes, you read right. she kills her victims by flying in the air in front of them, spreading her legs and letting the enemies become numbly charmed of the view, after which she flies closer and snaps their necks with her legs! the most usual last line the characters say in this film are like: \"i\\'ve never seen such a beautiful vagina\" and \"now i can die in peace.\" this film is totally fantastic!! there are also some great taunts towards japanese society for example its attitude towards sex in films (japanese censors optically fog/blur all the pubic hair in any film) and also about some restrictions among school students (like girls and boys are not allowed to talk in this film etc.) there\\'s one great scene in which one nerd sees girl\\'s bare you-know-what for the first time, and says \"hey there\\'s no fog in it!\" i couldn\\'t help but laugh during this scene as i thought what do the japanese censors think about this. also, one character says in the end that he will return, if japan films allows to make the sequel. i\\'m glad it allowed as i\\'ve heard the sequels are equally outrageous. one sequel should include blues brothers (yes, those blues brothers!) in it etc. this is trash in its most enjoyable, funniest and also cleverest form and so it is a little shame these films are so hard to find. this would definitely be even greater experience, if it was little more fast moving at times as it becomes little boring at one point, but fortunately those segments are very few. this film has to be seen to be fully believed as there are so many trash elements i don\\'t mention here and it wouldn\\'t be even necessary to tell them all here. if you like trash cinema and films made with tongue in very cheek, i think you\\'ll love this little gem as i do, and the director is definitely a genius in this field! 8/10 perhaps the only film in which a shining vagina is this lethal?',\n",

              " \"there can be no denying that hak se wui (election in english) is a well made and well thought out film. the film uses numerous clever pieces of identification all the time playing with modernity yet sticking to tradition \\x96 a theme played with throughout the film where john woo's hong kong films are action packed and over the top in their explosive content as seen in hard boiled (1992) and when hong kong films do settle down into rhythms of telling the story from the 'bad' point of view, they can sometimes stutter and just become merely unmemorable, a good example being city on fire (1987). election is a film that is memorable for the sheer fact of its unpredictable scenes, spontaneous action and violence that are done in a realistic and tasteful (if that's the right word) manner as well as the clever little 'in pieces' of film-making. it's difficult to spot during the viewing but election is really constructed in a kind of three act structure: there is the first point of concern involving the actual election and whoever is voted in is voted in \\x96 not everyone likes the decision but what the uncles say, goes. the second act is the retrieving of the ancient baton from china that tradition demands must be present during the inauguration with the final third the aftermath of the inauguration and certain characters coming up with their own ideas on how the triads should and could be run. needless to say; certain events and twists occur during each of the three thirds, some are small and immaterial whereas some are much larger and spectacular. election does have some faults with the majority coming in the opening third. trying to kill off time surrounding an election that only takes a few minutes to complete was clearly a hard task for the writers and filmmakers and that shows at numerous points. i got the feeling that a certain scene was just starting to go somewhere before it was interrupted by the police and then everyone gets arrested. this happens a few times: a fight breaks out in a restaurant but the police are there and everyone is arrested; there's a secret meeting about the baton between the triads but the police show up and everyone gets arrested; some other triads are having a pre-election talk but the police show up and guess what? you know. once the film gets out of that rut that i thought it would, it uses a sacred baton as a plot device to get everybody moving. the baton spawns some good fight scenes such as the chasing of a truck after it's been hotwired, another chase involving a motorbike and a kung-fu fight with a load of melee weapons in a street \\x96 the scenes are unpredictable, realistic and violent but like i said, they are in a 'tasteful' manner. where election really soars is its attention to that fine detail. when the triads are in jail, the bars are covered with wire suggesting they're all animals in cages as that's how they behave on the outside when in conflict. another fine piece of attention to detail is the way the uncles toast using tea and not alcohol, elevating themselves above other head gangsters who'd use champagne (the long good friday) and also referencing chinese tradition of drinking tea to celebrate or commemorate. election is a good film that is structured well enough to enjoy and a film that has fantastic mise-en-scene as you look at what's going on. some of the indoor settings and the clothing as well as the buckets of style that is poured on as the search and chase for the baton intensifies. the inauguration is like another short film entirely and very well integrated into the film; hinting at chinese tradition in the process. i feel the best scene is the ending scene as it sums it up perfectly: two shifty characters fishing and debating the ruling of the triads all the while remaining realistic, unpredictable and violent: in a tasteful manner, of course.\",\n",

              " 'first off, i must say that i made the mistake of watching the election films out of sequence. i say unfortunately, because after seeing election 2 first, election seems a bit of a disappointment. both films are gangster epics that are similar in form. and while election is an enjoyable piece of cinema... it\\'s just not nearly as good as it\\'s sequel. in the first election installment, we are shown the two competitors for chairman; big d and lok. after a few scenes of discussion amongst the \"uncle\\'s\" as to who should have the chairman title, they (almost unanimously) decide that lok (simon yam) will helm the triads. suffice to say this doesn\\'t go over very well with competitor big d (tony leung ka fai) and in a bid to influence the takeover, big d kidnaps two of the uncles in order to sway the election board to his side. this has disastrous results and heads the triads into an all out war. lok is determined to become chairman but won\\'t become official until he can recover the \"dragon head baton\", a material representation of the chairman\\'s power. the current chairman, whistle (chung wang) has hidden the baton somewhere in mainland china and the race is on to see who can recover it first. much of the film is devoted to the recovery of the baton. as both aspiring leaders search for it they must dodge cops and opposite sides, which leads into one of the stand out scenes in election, which involves an underling named jet (nick cheung), a machete, and lots of bad guys. nick cheung\\'s presence is attention grabbing to say the least... i wonder if this influenced director johhnie to in any way while making the second election, as he does deliver more of jet\\'s character in the sequel. while nick cheung gives a scene stealing performance, i must not fail to give due to the rest of the film\\'s actors. election has a great ensemble cast with well thought out performances that are both subtle and impacting. simon yam is his usually glorious self and the film also benefits from heavyweight hk actors like louis koo, tony leung ka fai, and the under-appreciated suet lam. there really aren\\'t any weak links in the acting and one could easily believe that they\\'re watching real gangsters. although the performances are great, one of the most impressive things about election is johnnie to\\'s eye for the camera. there are some truly striking shots in the film and it goes without saying that to definitely knows how to frame his shots, as the viewer is treated to a series of innovative and quite brilliant camera placings and angles. all of which makes election, above all, a great looking film. my issues with the film arises mostly out of the shear amount of characters involved in election. it gets a bit hard to follow because the film is so full of characters that aren\\'t integral to the plot. while the sequel opts to focus more on the two candidates, the first election offers the election process as a whole with tons of uncles, underlings, and police officers crowding the storyline. maybe the film would have worked better if it would have been a bit longer with more time dedicated to the inner workings of the triad, or if director johnnie to would have funneled down the necessary elements and expounded on them more. bottom line- all in all, this is a wonderfully brutal film with a great cast, excellent direction, and leisurely pacing that packs a punch. it\\'s just a little more complicated than it needed to be.',\n",
              " \"it might be a little erroneous to open a review by describing a film in terms of other films, but i think it's the best way to give an approximation of the place election occupies in the gangster genre arena. it works somewhere in between the godfather and kinji fukasaku's yakuza opus the yakuza papers (aka battles without honour and humanity), in that it is simultaneously both romanticized and realistic, dark and gritty. but it's also a johnnie to film, and as such it carries the distinct touch of the hong kong auteur. every two years the hk triad elects a new boss. only this time one of the candidates is not overly happy with the result so he decides to take matters into his own hands much to the dismay of the rest of the triads and the police. that's the story in a nutshell but rest assured it has a lot more going for it than that. as in the yakuza papers, there's a great deal of scheming, back-stabbing and forming and switching of allegiances (sometimes all it takes is a phone call - in one of the most memorable scenes i've seen in recent time) which might not necessarily make for deep drama but makes for an interesting plot and good character conflict. fans of the gangster genre are likely to appreciate it in that aspect. election is not as action-oriented as one might expect; although it is violent. and i'm not talking about the glossy, glamour version of hollywood violence. this is dark and grim. to's camera lingers in the scenes of people being brutalized in ways that reveal both the humanity and inhumanity of the perpetrators and victims; after all violence is an integral part of us whether we like it or not. if you're familiar with to's style, then you should know what to expect. the pacing is relatively slow and deliberate. the cinematography is great, slick and dark in equal measures, utilizing dark hues (brown, dark green and orange) while the smooth tracking shots add a vibrant quality to it. in the end, election occupies a peculiar place. it's not exactly a character study and it's not an action-oriented gangster film. it explores a situation (the election and its aftermath), but does so in style, and is both realistic and romanticized (the triad ceremonies in particular echo of an oriental godfather).\",\n",

              " 'twelve years ago, production stopped on the slasher flick \"hot blooded\" since almost everyone on the set started dying. now, a couple of film students have decided to finish the film, despite the fact that there\\'s a rumor that the film is cursed. well, they\\'re about to find out that some curses are real. when scream was released, every country seemed to want to cash in on its success, even australia. the concept, which today has been done to death (a slasher film within a slasher film) was at the time relatively cool and original. this movie was released right before urban legends: final cut and scream 3 (well not in the us but in australia) so it felt like the first movie with this concept. when urban legends 2 was released, most of us had all ready grown sick of the concept and since the movie wasn\\'t even good, the movie flopped disastrously. now, cut is not the best slasher flick ever, and nor does it try to be. it knows that it\\'s a rip-off, and they even cast a girl who looks like a blonde version of neve campbell in the starring role. but instead of trying to add some new and original twists to the story, they\\'ve decided to rip-off some 80s slasher flicks like \"nightmare on elm street\" as well and surprisingly enough, this actually works. the killer is very creepy and that mask is just killer! and instead of trying to scare the audience to death, they\\'ve created a very good and creepy atmosphere which keeps us in suspense through most of the movie. there are a couple of plot holes in the movie though that i wasn\\'t able to fully ignore, the ending being the biggest plot hole in the movie. spoiler ahead; i mean, they burnt the only copy of the movie so where the hell did they find the print that they show in the final scene? it makes no sense i tell you. end of spoilers. all in all, cut is a pretty creepy slasher flick with a silly story but i consider this to be one of the better scream rip-offs that never made it big. i\\'m surprised that this one never got a sequel, but i guess it simply came out too late. suspenseful australian slasher flick with very few scares. cut is still a pretty neat slasher movie and i will have to recommend this one even though i consider the story to be quite silly since it\\'s completely ludicrous.',\n",
              " 'when i think of the cheesiest guilty pleasure-type movies, the first thing i think of are \\'80s slasher flicks. really bad slasher flicks. the formulaic type of film, where all a script needed was 2 parts blood and several parts nudity to get made. flash forward to the late \\'90s/early \\'00s. the slasher flick has been revitalized with the success of 1996\\'s \"scream\". like in the \\'80s, these films were formulaic, masking a lack of inspiration by labelling themselves as \"hip, tongue-in-cheek parodies\" of the original slasher flicks. of this recent blend of \"hip parody\" neo-slasher flicks, the only one worth seeing is the low-budget, direct-to-video \"cut\". like most of the other \"new\" slasher flicks, \"cut\" relies on the production of a slasher flick, in this case a fictional 1985 film \"hot blooded\", to make its commentary on the genre. \"hot blooded\" never finished production, because of killings by someone wearing the mask of the film\\'s killer, scarman, a bald figure with its mouth stitched close and dark, pupil-less eyes. now, 12 years later, a group of film students, whose professor was involved in the production, have decided to go into the vaults, tap the original surviving actress, and finish the film. but every time the film is screened or a scene is shot, \"scarman\" returns and someone dies. to quote the tagline, will they finish the film before it finishes them? this all sounds really bad, and to a degree it is (really, is there such a thing as a good slasher flick?). there is no character development (the \"new\" director is revealed to be the daughter of \"hot blooded\"\\'s original director, whose life was apparently ruined after the production was cancelled; this would\\'ve been a perfect detail to be worked into the plot, yet it\\'s never mentioned again) and, like in all other slasher flicks, there are just too many bodies to care about. the actors aren\\'t great, even by direct-to-video standards, but most are having fun with their characters (and for those who aren\\'t, it\\'s inadvertent character acting, since none of their characters in the film wanted to work on \"hot blooded\"), particularly whoever was lucky enough to play scarman. \"cut\"\\'s climax has no big \"who dunnit\" unmasking of the killer like in the \"scream\" films. it doesn\\'t have the gimmick killings of the \"urban legend\" films. what it does have is an original and interesting concept that is diluted by a \"this way we can write a sequel if it sells well\" ending. but that\\'s par for the course. by any sensible viewing standards, this is a horrible movie that should be avoided, but this \"quality\" is what makes it true to its roots in the slasher genre, and this is what makes it more enjoyable than any of the other neo-slasher flicks.',\n",
