# Sentiment Analysis by BERT:
BERT is state-of-the-art natural language processing model from Google. Using its latent space, it can be repurpossed for various NLP tasks, such as sentiment analysis.  

I am using [Hugging Face Transformers](https://github.com/huggingface/transformers) and Pytorch and the task is predicting positivity / negativity on IMDB reviews.
